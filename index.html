        <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website. It is a work in progress, but the goal is to have it up and
          running by the end of 2019.</p>

        <p><b>About the Title.</b> In order to perform certain statistical tasks, we sometimes make assumptions about
          how a <b>Data Generating Process</b> (DGP) behaves. Often times, analysis based on that data revolve
          around a question that can phrased as follows:
        </p>

        <p class="center">
          <em>If our assumptions about the DGP are correct, <br>then how likely is it that the DGP would generate the
            results that we have observed?</em>
        </p>
        <p>

          To address this question, we contrast what is <b>expected</b> to be produced by the DGP via our theory with what is
          <b>observed</b> through empirical evidence. In this way, we can gain an idea about the validity of our
          assumptions. </p>

        <p>This interplay between the theoretical and the empirical makes the study of statistics both attractive and challenging.  If they were alive today, Plato would be happy to see how often the math in Mathematical Statistics works out nicely, while Aristotle would be asking us to make sure that the theory that we are developing actually applies to the real world.</p>
