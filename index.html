        <h4> Introduction</h4>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website! It is a work in progress, but the goal is to have it up and
          running by the end of January, 2020.</p>

        <p>
          I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="https://www.umc.edu/SoPH/Departments-and-Faculty/Data-Science/Department-of-Data-Science-Home.html">Department of Data Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.umc.edu/">University of Mississippi Medical Center</a> (UMMC). I will complete the second year of my graduate studies in Data Science in May, 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          I obtained a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Mississippi in the
          Spring of 2017. My dissertation, entitled <a href="files/Dissertation.pdf"><em>Asymptotic Properties of Polynomials
            Orthogonal over Multiply Connected Domains</em> </a> , was a work of "pure mathematics." By this, I mean that it
          would be difficult to apply the main results of my thesis to any problem that might arise in the real world.
          Soon after graduation,
          I became interested in learning more about tools and techniques that <em>could</em>  be
          applied to real world problems. Consequently, I decided to join the Department
          of Data Science at UMMC in the Fall of 2018.

        </p>
        The courses I have taken over the past year and a half have focused on Biostatistics, Statistical Learning, and
        Programming. I have gained experience working
        with SAS, Stata, R, and Python. Currently, I prefer to use R for data cleaning
        and plotting, Stata for statistical analysis, and Python for Machine Learning.
        </p>


        <p> <b>About the Image on the Right.</b> Coming from a "pure math" background, I often think about the interplay
          between the theoretical and the empirical when working with Statistics. If they were alive today, I'd like to
          think that Plato would enjoy seeing how often the math in Statistics works out nicely, while Aristotle would
          be hounding us to make sure that the theory that we are developing actually applies to the real world.</p>

            concept of form, Plato is associated with Theory. Meanwhile, Aristotle is associated with empirical
            evidence.</p>

                    and visualzations were performed in R and Stata. The document was written in LaTeX. </p>

                    I could get some experience working with Spotify's API. It is a Python 3 Notebook, and it was during
                    the Fall of 2019.  In terms of code quality, the notebook isn't very polished.  Nevertheless, I have found it to be very useful over the past couple of months.</p>
