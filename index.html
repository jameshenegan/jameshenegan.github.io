        <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website. It is a work in progress, but the goal is to have it up and
          running by the end of January, 2019.</p>

          <p>
        I am a doctoral
          candidate in the Department of Data Science at the University of Mississippi
          Medical Center (UMMC). I will complete the second year of my graduate studies in Data Science in May, 2020.
        </p>
        
<p>
          I obtained a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Mississippi in the
          Spring of 2017. My dissertation, entitled  <em>Asymptotic Properties of Polynomials
          Orthogonal over Multiply Connected Domains</em> , was a work of "pure mathematics." By this, I mean that it would be difficult to apply the results of my dissertation to any problem that might arise in the real world. Soon after graduation,
          I became interested in learning more about tools and techniques that could be
          applied to real world problems. Consequently, I decided to join the Department
          of Data Science at UMMC in the Fall of 2018.

        </p>
          The courses I have taken over the past year and a half have focused on Biostatistics, Statistical Learning, and Programming. I have gained experience working
          with SAS, Stata, R, and Python. Currently, I prefer to use R for data cleaning
          and plotting, Stata for statistical analysis, and Python for Machine Learning.
          However, I am always willing to learn more about programming, especially if I
          need to do so in order to fit into a work environment.
        </p>

 
        <p> <b>About the Image on the Right.</b>  Coming from a "pure math" background, I often think about the interplay between the theoretical and the empirical in Statistics.  If they were alive today, I'd like to think that Plato would enjoy seeing how often the math
          in Theoeretical Statistics works out nicely, while Aristotle would be hounding us to make sure that the theory that we are developing actually applies to the real world.</p>
