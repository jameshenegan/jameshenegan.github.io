          <b>Professional.</b>
          As a Data Scientist II with a focus on aging and cognition in the
          healthcare industry, my primary responsibility is to analyze complex
          healthcare-related data sets and develop insights and recommendations
          to improve patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. Working on a
          small team, I also take on additional tasks related to data
          engineering, application development, and DevOps. I am proficient in
          using Python for data engineering and data science tasks, the React
          framework for development, and Linux for DevOps tasks, enabling me to
          contribute effectively to various aspects of the data analysis and
          presentation process.
        </p>

          <b>Personal.</b> Throughout my life, I've pursued a diverse array of
          interests and hobbies, including baseball, mathematics, music,
          computer programming, travel, and philosophy.
