        <h4> Introduction</h4>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website! It is a work in progress, but the goal is to have it up and
          running by the end of January, 2020.</p>

          <p>
        I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Data Science at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC). I will complete the second year of my graduate studies in Data Science in May, 2020.
        </p>
        
<p>
          I obtained a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Mississippi in the
          Spring of 2017. My dissertation, entitled  <em>Asymptotic Properties of Polynomials
          Orthogonal over Multiply Connected Domains</em> , was a work of "pure mathematics." By this, I mean that it would be difficult to apply the results of my dissertation to any problem that might arise in the real world. Soon after graduation,
          I became interested in learning more about tools and techniques that could be
          applied to real world problems. Consequently, I decided to join the Department
          of Data Science at UMMC in the Fall of 2018.

        </p>
          The courses I have taken over the past year and a half have focused on Biostatistics, Statistical Learning, and Programming. I have gained experience working
          with SAS, Stata, R, and Python. Currently, I prefer to use R for data cleaning
          and plotting, Stata for statistical analysis, and Python for Machine Learning.          
        </p>

 
        <p> <b>About the Image on the Right.</b>  Coming from a "pure math" background, I often think about the interplay between the theoretical and the empirical when working with Statistics.  If they were alive today, I'd like to think that Plato would enjoy seeing how often the math in Statistics works out nicely, while Aristotle would be hounding us to make sure that the theory that we are developing actually applies to the real world.</p>

          <h4> Selected Works</h4> 
          
          <p>
          
          The collection below is meant to serve as a sample of the type of work that I can produce.</p>
          
          <p>The first item in the collection is my final project for a Survival Analysis course I took in the Fall of 2019.  The statistical analyses and visualzations were performed in R and Stata.  The document was written in LaTeX. </p> 
          
          
          <div class="collection">
            <a href="files/Survival Analysis - Final Report.pdf" class="collection-item"> <em> Case Study: The impact of tumor location on survival
              outcomes for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and
              treated with surgery in Louisiana between 2004 and 2016.</em>  
              </a>         
          </div>
          
          <p>The second is a Jupyter Notebook I wrote using Google's Colaboratory so that I could get some experience working with Spotify's API.  It is a Python 3 Notebook, and it was created near the end of Summer, 2019.</p>

          <a href="https://github.com/jameshenegan/api-works/blob/master/Spotify_API.ipynb" class="collection-item"> <em>Working with the Spotify API</em> </a>          
      </div>

      <p>The third is an article I wrote on the concept of "variability" while I was learning about the R programming language in the Spring of 2019.</p>
