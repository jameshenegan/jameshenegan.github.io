    <p><b>Welcome</b> to my personal website.  I am working on it.  I want it to be up and running by November 11.</p>

    <p><b>About the Title.</b>  In order to perform certain statistical tasks, we will sometimes make assumptions about how a <b>Data Generating Process</b> (DGP) behaves.  Often times, the resulting statistical analysis is based on a question that can phrased as follows: 
    </p>

    <p class = "center">
        <em>If our assumptions about the DGP are correct, <br>then how likely is it that the DGP would generate the results that we have observed?</em>
    </p>
    <p>

    To address this question, we contrast what is <b>expected</b> to be produced by the DGP with what is <b>observed</b> through empirical evidence.  In this way, we can gain an idea about the validity of our assumptions.</p>
