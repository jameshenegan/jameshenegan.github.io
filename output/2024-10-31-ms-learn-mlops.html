to DevOps principles for machine learning</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The increase in machine learning (ML) projects is driven by more
accessible data, computational power, and advancements in algorithms.
However, a significant challenge in scaling ML projects is the absence
of a clear strategy and the existence of organizational silos.</p>
<p>MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) aims to bridge this gap by
streamlining the transition from ML proofs of concept to full-scale
production. MLOps ensures that ML workflows are robust, reproducible,
and scalable by allowing for continuous monitoring, retraining, and
redeployment of models. This lifecycle involves training, packaging,
validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models, facilitated by
both data scientists and ML engineers who apply DevOps practices.</p>
<p>DevOps principles such as agile planning, source control, and
automation accelerate the ML lifecycle and enhance collaboration. This
module introduces DevOps concepts and how tools like Azure DevOps and
GitHub can integrate with Azure Machine Learning to optimize ML project
management.</p>
<p><strong>Learning objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand DevOps benefits for ML projects.</li>
<li>Learn applicable DevOps principles.</li>
<li>Discover integration of Azure DevOps and GitHub with Azure ML.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devops-for-machine-learning">DevOps for machine learning</h3>
<p>The “DevOps for Machine Learning” module discusses integrating DevOps
principles into MLOps to improve the scalability, reproducibility, and
efficiency of machine learning projects.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>DevOps and MLOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps focuses on uniting people, processes, and tools to provide
continuous value, emphasizing automation, rapid delivery, and
reproducibility.</li>
<li>MLOps applies these principles to ML, organizing the ML lifecycle
(exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training,
validation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Three Key Processes in MLOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML</strong>: Data scientists handle model training, tuning,
and feature engineering.</li>
<li><strong>DEV</strong>: Software development focuses on planning,
creating, verifying, and packaging ML models.</li>
<li><strong>OPS</strong>: Operations handle deployment, monitoring, and
infrastructure management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>DevOps Principles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> is core, ensuring quick, reproducible
deployments through CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous
Delivery).</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong> involves code creation,
verification, and testing, transforming exploratory code into
production-ready scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> automates model deployment,
utilizing pre-production staging to ensure reliability before
production.</li>
<li><strong>Source Control</strong> (e.g., Git-based repositories)
enables versioning, collaboration, and tracking changes.</li>
<li><strong>Agile Planning</strong> structures work into sprints, which
facilitates quick deployment and iterative improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong> standardizes
infrastructure configurations, automating environment setup to ensure
consistency.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These principles and processes ensure that ML projects remain
scalable, collaborative, and adaptable to changes, ultimately enhancing
their reliability and alignment with business needs. DevOps tools like
Azure DevOps and GitHub support these workflows.</p>
<h3 id="devops-tools">DevOps tools</h3>
<p>The “DevOps Tools” module introduces essential tools for implementing
DevOps practices, specifically focusing on Azure DevOps, GitHub, and
Git, which are valuable for machine learning projects.</p>
<p>Key Tools: Azure DevOps:</p>
<p>A Microsoft platform offering services to streamline DevOps
workflows, adaptable across multiple languages and platforms, often used
with Python and Linux for ML. Key components include: Azure Boards:
Tracks and organizes agile planning with work items, visualizations, and
reports. Azure Repos: Stores code in public and private repositories.
Azure Pipelines: Supports continuous integration (CI) and continuous
delivery (CD) by automating builds and tests. GitHub:</p>
<p>A development platform for open-source projects, combining Git
repositories with DevOps tools. Key features: Issues: Manages work

projects within Azure DevOps.</li>
<li><strong>Service Connection</strong>: To connect Azure DevOps to AML,
a service principal is created in Microsoft Entra ID, providing a secure
identity for AML authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Within each project, administrators
configure the service connection to enable Azure DevOps pipelines to
manage the AML workspace securely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Integration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup</strong>: Administrators create a GitHub repository,
owned individually or by an organization.</li>
<li><strong>Service Principal &amp; Secrets</strong>: Using Azure CLI, a
service principal with Contributor access to AML is created. The
credentials are stored as a GitHub secret (named
<code>AZURE_CREDENTIALS</code>) to enable secure connections.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets Management</strong>: The secret enables GitHub
Actions to authenticate and interact with AML workflows seamlessly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These integrations streamline ML workflows by enabling secure
automation for project management, code collaboration, and continuous
integration and deployment in AML projects.</p>
<h2 id="source-control-for-machine-learning-projects">Source control for
machine learning projects</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>This module discusses using repositories and trunk-based development
for managing code in machine learning projects, especially with DevOps
tools like Azure DevOps and GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="key-points-1">Key Points:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Repositories</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repositories (repos) store code and enable collaboration. Common
choices are Azure Repos in Azure DevOps or GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Repo Scoping</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Monorepo</strong>: Stores all ML workloads in a single repo,
offering easy access for all team members.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Repos</strong>: Each ML project has a separate
repo, which provides more controlled access but adds management
overhead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Folder Structure</strong>: Standardized folders within each
repo improve navigation, typically including:
<ul>
<li><code>.cloud</code> for cloud-specific code,</li>
<li><code>.ad/.github</code> for pipeline artifacts,</li>
<li><code>src</code> for ML scripts,</li>
<li><code>docs</code> for documentation,</li>
<li><code>pipelines</code> for AML pipeline definitions,</li>
<li><code>tests</code> for unit/integration tests, and</li>
<li><code>notebooks</code> for experimental Jupyter notebooks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Training data should be stored
externally in databases or data lakes, accessible directly by AML.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Trunk-Based Development</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Git workflow where the main branch hosts production code.</li>
<li>Developers create branches to modify code, request reviews, and
merge approved changes back into the main branch, ensuring only verified
updates reach production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This setup promotes code organization, controlled access, and
collaborative development, making it easier for teams to manage ML
project workflows.</p>
<h3 id="work-with-azure-repos-and-github-repos">Work with Azure Repos
and GitHub repos</h3>
<p>This module explains how to work with Azure Repos and GitHub
repositories for code management in machine learning projects,
emphasizing trunk-based development and agile planning.</p>
<h4 id="key-points-2">Key Points:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trunk-Based Development</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best practice for making code changes involves using branches
instead of directly modifying the main code. This allows for testing and
review before merging updates into production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Agile Planning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates to machine learning models may be required due to issues
like data drift. Agile planning tools, such as <strong>Azure
Boards</strong> in Azure DevOps or <strong>GitHub Issues</strong>, help
organize these updates and assign work items.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Working with Azure DevOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Boards</strong> organizes tasks into backlogs, which
are assigned to team members and tracked as work items.</li>
<li>When assigned a work item, data scientists can create a new branch
directly linked to the item. Development is typically done by cloning
the branch into an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for local testing and
refinement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Working with GitHub</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub’s <strong>Issues</strong> tool is used to log tasks, bugs,
and feedback within a repository.</li>
<li>Team members can assign themselves to issues, create linked branches
for each task, and perform local development and testing after cloning
the branch to an IDE.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>By following these practices, teams ensure organized, tested, and
collaborative code updates in ML workflows.</p>
<h3 id="develop-locally-with-visual-studio-code">Develop locally with
Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>This module details the process of developing code locally for
machine learning projects using Visual Studio Code, while maintaining
version control with Git-based repositories such as Azure Repos or
GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="key-steps">Key Steps:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Branching for Development</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When updating or improving models, data scientists create a separate
branch to isolate their work from the production model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Setting Up Visual Studio Code</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular IDE for local development.
It supports Azure Machine Learning extensions, allowing you to run code
on Azure compute resources or your local device, depending on the
computational requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Development Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clone</strong>: Copy the repository (repo) to your local
environment using the repo’s URL and the Git clone command in VS Code’s
command palette or terminal.</li>
<li><strong>Edit and Commit</strong>: Make and save code changes, then
commit each change with a message for clarity. Small, frequent commits
with clear messages improve team understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong>: Once changes are committed, push them to
update the main repo. You can use the Source Control pane in VS Code for
this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Verification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before pushing, it’s recommended to verify code through linting and
unit tests to maintain quality.</li>
<li>If other team members have modified the repo, you can
<strong>pull</strong> updates to sync your local version without losing
changes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow helps data scientists maintain control over their
contributions and ensures smooth collaboration on ML projects.</p>
<h3 id="verify-your-code-locally">Verify your code locally</h3>
<p>This module explains verifying code in machine learning projects by
running <strong>linting</strong> and <strong>unit testing</strong>
locally, ensuring quality before changes are deployed or integrated.</p>
<h4 id="key-steps-1">Key Steps:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Linting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Ensures code follows team standards,
checking for syntax and style errors.</li>
<li><strong>Using Flake8 with Visual Studio Code</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Install Flake8 (<code>pip install flake8</code>).</li>
<li>Configure with a <code>.flake8</code> file to set rules (e.g., line
length limits, ignored errors).</li>
<li>Errors and warnings are underlined in VS Code, and specific issues
can be viewed under the <strong>Problems</strong> tab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Automated Linting</strong>: In Azure Pipelines or GitHub
Actions, define CI workflows to automate linting with Flake8.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Unit Testing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Verifies functionality by testing
individual code components, like data preparation and model training
functions.</li>
<li><strong>Using Pytest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Write test functions in files (e.g., <code>test_train.py</code>)
that check expected outputs using assert statements (e.g., with NumPy
assertions for model predictions).</li>
<li><strong>Run Tests in VS Code</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Configure VS Code for Pytest and run tests from the
<strong>Testing</strong> tab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>: In CI pipelines (Azure DevOps or
GitHub Actions), run tests using Pytest after installing
dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Verifying code with linting and unit tests ensures quality, prevents
errors in production, and aligns with CI/CD workflows by catching issues
early.</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand how to create and use <strong>Azure Machine Learning
pipelines</strong>.</li>
<li>Learn how to automate workflows using <strong>Azure
Pipelines</strong> and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type of pipeline will be specifically referenced by its full
name (e.g., Azure Machine Learning pipelines) to clarify the service in
use.</p>
<h3 id="azure-machine-learning-pipelines">Azure Machine Learning
pipelines</h3>
<p>This module covers creating and automating machine learning workflows

<li><p><strong>Experimentation in AML</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>AML enables data scientists to register datasets, train models on
remote compute resources, track experiment results, and register models
for deployment.</li>
<li>To transition from experimentation (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) to
production, code should be refactored into functions, grouped in Python
scripts, and unit-tested.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating AML Pipelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AML pipelines</strong> organize ML workflows by grouping
tasks into a sequence, which can then be scheduled or triggered.</li>
<li>Pipelines are defined in <strong>YAML</strong> to specify task
details:
<ul>
<li><strong>Steps</strong>: Defined as Python scripts or reusable
components.</li>
<li><strong>Inputs/Outputs</strong>: Specify data inputs and
outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Compute Resources</strong>: Set up compute environments,
often using AML compute clusters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>YAML files make pipelines reusable and shareable within the AML
workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pipeline Example and Execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample YAML defines two jobs, <code>transform-job</code> and
<code>train-job</code>, each handling data transformation and model
training, respectively.</li>
<li>Pipelines are executed in AML using CLI commands, enabling
integration with automation tools like Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions
for continuous model training and retraining.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This pipeline setup allows teams to automate and scale ML tasks
efficiently, preparing models for continuous production deployment.</p>
<h3 id="azure-pipelines">Azure Pipelines</h3>
<p>This module explains how to automate workflows in machine learning
projects using Azure Pipelines as part of Azure DevOps. Azure Pipelines
can automate tasks such as creating assets, triggering Azure Machine
Learning (AML) pipelines, and managing model deployment.</p>
<p>Key Steps: Setting up Azure Pipelines:</p>
<p>Azure Pipelines automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., repo
changes). To use Azure Pipelines with AML, a service connection is
established between Azure DevOps and the AML workspace. Pipeline
Structure:</p>
<p>Pipelines are defined in YAML and include: Trigger: Initiates the
pipeline (e.g., repo commit). Stages: Groups of jobs for different
environments (dev, test, prod). Jobs: Sets of steps executed on agents
(e.g., Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu). Steps: Commands or scripts, such as
initiating an AML pipeline using CLI commands. Running AML Pipelines in
Azure Pipelines:</p>
<p>A sample YAML file uses az ml job create to run the AML pipeline
defined in a file like pipeline-job.yml. Parameters can make YAML files
reusable across projects. Configuring and Running the Pipeline:</p>
<p>In Azure DevOps, select the YAML file in the repo to configure and
run the pipeline. Once set up, commits to the main branch automatically
trigger the pipeline. Job status and error messages can be reviewed in
Azure DevOps and the AML workspace. This setup supports seamless,
automated workflow execution for machine learning tasks, improving
efficiency and scalability in production.</p>
<h3 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions</h3>
<p>This module explains how to use <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to
automate workflows in machine learning projects hosted on GitHub. GitHub
Actions enable tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code, with
secure integration into Azure Machine Learning (AML) pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="key-steps-3">Key Steps:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Setting Up GitHub Actions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions workflows are defined in <strong>YAML</strong> files
stored in the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory of a GitHub
repo.</li>
<li>Actions are triggered by events (e.g., a code push) and consist of:
<ul>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong>: Run on a virtual machine (typically
Ubuntu).</li>
<li><strong>Steps</strong>: Commands or actions to execute, like
initiating an AML pipeline.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Example YAML Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample YAML workflow file includes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Event Trigger</strong>: Runs on a push to the main
branch.</li>
<li><strong>Steps</strong>: Check out the repo, install AML CLI,
authenticate with Azure using <code>AZURE_CREDENTIALS</code>, set the
working directory, and run the AML pipeline.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Running and Monitoring Workflows</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflows automatically run when triggered (e.g., by a code
push).</li>
<li>To monitor workflow results, view the <strong>GitHub Actions
tab</strong> for details on each step’s success or errors.</li>
<li>When a workflow triggers an AML pipeline, review the pipeline in the
AML workspace to ensure all steps executed correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub Actions simplify continuous integration and deployment for ML
projects, helping automate processes and monitor workflows
efficiently.</p>
