  <body><h1 id="comparison">Comparison</h1>
<p>Below is a <strong>comprehensive comparison</strong> of
<strong>traditional</strong> versus <strong>accelerated</strong> life
insurance underwriting, highlighting <strong>key steps</strong>,
<strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>applicant experience</strong>,
and <strong>outcomes</strong>. The overarching goal is to show
<strong>how</strong> these two underwriting pathways differ in
practice—and <strong>why</strong> an insurer might choose one over the
other for specific segments of applicants.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting (TU)</strong><br />
A <strong>fully underwritten</strong> process where the insurer gathers
detailed health information, typically including blood/urine labs,
physical measurements (paramedical exam), medical records (APS), and
possibly more detailed financial or lifestyle data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting (AU)</strong><br />
A streamlined process that often <strong>waives</strong> some or all
invasive requirements (no fluid tests, no paramed), instead relying on
<strong>predictive models</strong>, <strong>third-party data
sources</strong>, and <strong>data analytics</strong> to assess risk
more quickly.</p></li>

<hr />
<h2 id="underwriting-timeline">3. Underwriting Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can take <strong>weeks</strong> or sometimes
<strong>months</strong>, especially if APS retrieval is slow or if there
are scheduling issues for paramed exams.</li>
<li>The insurer waits for lab results, exam reports, and possibly
additional underwriting queries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Often completed in <strong>days</strong>—in some cases, within
<strong>24-48 hours</strong>—because data checks (MIB, prescription,
credit) are run instantly or near-instantly.</li>
<li>Fewer (or no) requirements mean less waiting on external
vendors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="applicant-experience">4. Applicant Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More invasive</strong>: Blood draw, urine sample, scheduling
a paramed nurse visit.</li>
<li><strong>More time-consuming</strong>: Applicant must accommodate
medical appointments, fill out longer questionnaires, and wait for
results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More convenient</strong>: Generally no paramed, no
labs.</li>
<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Many applicants receive immediate or
near-immediate offers if data checks support a favorable risk
class.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="coverage-amounts-eligibility">5. Coverage Amounts &amp;
Eligibility</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Historically used for <strong>higher face amounts</strong> (e.g.,
$1M+) or applicants with <strong>complex health histories</strong>.</li>
<li>Some carriers use it for <strong>all</strong> face amounts unless
the individual qualifies for a special AU program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Often limited to <strong>lower-to-mid</strong> face amounts (e.g.,
up to $500K or $1M), though this limit is rising with better
models.</li>
<li>Generally targeted at <strong>younger</strong> or
<strong>healthier</strong> applicants, or those who pass initial
prescreening criteria (credit, RX, MIB).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="risk-classification-accuracy-slippage">6. Risk Classification
Accuracy &amp; Slippage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> in risk detection
because labs, exams, and APS can uncover hidden health issues.</li>
<li><strong>Less slippage</strong> because the process is
thorough—though it’s not 100% perfect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relies heavily on <strong>predictive modeling</strong>. If models
are well-calibrated, the majority of healthy or low-risk individuals are
<strong>correctly</strong> classified.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for slippage</strong> if hidden health conditions
or risky behaviors are not captured by data checks (credit, RX,
etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="cost-to-insurer">7. Cost to Insurer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher direct costs</strong>: medical exams, lab processing,
APS retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect costs</strong>: more underwriting hours, potential
for lost applicants during a long process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower direct costs</strong>: fewer medical requirements,
minimal lab work.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in data platforms</strong>: subscription fees for
prescription checks, credit data, and predictive modeling services.</li>
<li><strong>Lower friction</strong>: reduces drop-off due to simpler
processes, potentially improving placement ratios (unless
misclassifications become an issue).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">8. Pros and Cons</h2>
<p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>Thorough, reduces risk of adverse selection.</li>
<li>Greater confidence in final classification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slower, more invasive, can discourage some applicants.</li>
<li>Higher underwriting costs and overhead.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>Faster decisions, enhanced customer experience.</li>
<li>Lower underwriting costs and potentially higher placement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Risks missing health issues not flagged by credit or RX data
(slippage).</li>
<li>May be limited to specific face amounts or certain “low-risk”
segments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="use-cases-when-to-use-which-approach">9. Use Cases / When to Use
Which Approach</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong> is preferable when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The applicant seeks <strong>high coverage</strong> amounts.</li>
<li>The applicant has <strong>complex health issues</strong> that
require deeper investigation.</li>
<li>The insurer’s risk appetite demands a <strong>very detailed</strong>
assessment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong> fits well when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The applicant is relatively <strong>young, healthy</strong>, or
meets certain “ideal” profiles.</li>
<li>Coverage amounts are within <strong>mid-level</strong> thresholds
(though many carriers are raising them).</li>
<li>The carrier wants to <strong>reduce friction</strong> and meet
consumer demands for <strong>quick, digital</strong> processes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="hybrid-models-and-future-trends">10. Hybrid Models and Future
Trends</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Some insurers use <strong>“hybrid”</strong> approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start everyone in an <strong>accelerated</strong> pipeline, then
<strong>“triage”</strong> high-risk or suspicious cases into
<strong>traditional</strong> underwriting.</li>
<li>This optimizes cost efficiency while preserving robust risk
management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Emerging Trends</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More <strong>predictive analytics</strong>, advanced data sources
(e.g., EHR integrations, real-time data from wearables).</li>
<li>Ongoing <strong>hold-out studies</strong> to measure any slippage
and refine accelerated underwriting rules.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional underwriting</strong> is meticulous and accurate
but can be slow and costly.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated underwriting</strong> is rapid and
customer-friendly but must be well-managed to avoid
<strong>misclassification</strong> risks.</li>
<li>The <strong>ideal approach</strong> often depends on a carrier’s
<strong>risk appetite</strong>, <strong>target market</strong>, and
<strong>technological infrastructure</strong>.</li>
<li>Many carriers are <strong>expanding</strong> accelerated programs as
models improve, aiming for a <strong>balanced</strong> solution that
satisfies customers while managing mortality risks effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="placement">Placement</h1>
<p>In a life insurance context, “placement” refers to the point at which
a policy is officially put in force (or “placed”) after the underwriting
process has been completed and the applicant has accepted the final
offer. Here’s a breakdown of how it typically works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Application and Preliminary Quote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The prospective insured fills out an application with the
agent.</li>
<li>Often, the agent provides an initial premium estimate or
“illustration,” but this is not binding because underwriting has yet to
review the individual’s health and risk factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Underwriting Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The life insurance company’s underwriters assess the applicant’s
medical records, possibly order exams, blood tests, and gather any other
needed information (e.g., motor vehicle reports).</li>
<li>Based on these findings, the underwriter decides on the final
underwriting class (e.g., Preferred, Standard, Substandard) and the
corresponding premium.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Offer and Acceptance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once underwriting is complete, the insurance company will issue the
policy (with the final rates).</li>
<li>The applicant (through the agent) reviews the offer. If it differs
from the initial quote, the applicant can choose to accept or decline
it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Placement (“Policy Placed In Force”)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the applicant accepts the final offer, the policy is “placed” in
force. This typically requires the first premium payment and (in many
cases) signing a delivery receipt or statement of good health, depending
on the insurer’s rules and the time elapsed since the application.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, <strong>“placement”</strong> is the last step in the
underwriting journey, where the policy transitions from merely
“approved” to “active.” At that point, the customer has a valid,
enforceable insurance contract, and the life insurance coverage is
officially in effect.</p>
<h1 id="slippage">Slippage</h1>
<p>There’s actually <strong>more than one way</strong> the term
“slippage” is used in the life insurance business, and you’re touching
on a different (but equally important) usage tied to underwriting
<strong>accuracy</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="slippage-as-lost-placements">1. Slippage as Lost Placements</h3>
<p>In many sales or distribution contexts, “slippage” refers to the gap
between policies approved/offered and those that actually get placed in
force (i.e., the business that “slips away” because the client doesn’t
accept, finds a better offer, or otherwise declines).</p>
<h3 id="slippage-as-underwriting-error-or-misclassification">2. Slippage
as Underwriting Error or Misclassification</h3>
<p>However, <strong>within the underwriting and actuarial
arena</strong>, “slippage” can also mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discrepancy between the risk classification <strong>an applicant
really qualifies for</strong> and the <strong>more favorable
classification</strong> they end up receiving due to underwriting
oversights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, an applicant who should have been classified as
Substandard (a higher-risk category with higher premiums) might be
mistakenly classified as Preferred (a lower-risk category with lower
premiums). This is sometimes called <strong>“favorable
slippage”</strong> for the insured, but it’s unfavorable for the
insurer’s profitability since the insurer is not collecting adequate
premiums to match the true level of risk.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="why-this-misclassification-slippage-matters">Why This
“Misclassification Slippage” Matters</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Financial Risk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a company underestimates risk (by putting someone in Preferred
instead of Substandard), it can collect much lower premiums than
necessary to offset potential claims.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Underwriting Integrity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent classification ensures fairness and stability. When
guidelines aren’t followed or mistakes creep in, it undermines the
quality of the underwriting process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact on Pricing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If enough policies slip through at lower rates than warranted, it
can affect the insurer’s overall pricing assumptions and profitability
in a product line.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>So, depending on <strong>who in the organization</strong> is using
the term “slippage,” it might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>From a Sales Perspective</strong>: The percentage of
policies that fall through after approval and never get placed (lost
business).</li>
<li><strong>From an Underwriting/Actuarial Perspective</strong>:
Incorrect (usually too-lenient) risk classifications that lead to
underpricing for the actual level of risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both usages are valid in life insurance, but the second scenario you
mentioned—“someone was classified Preferred when they really should be
Substandard”—fits squarely into the <strong>underwriting error</strong>
definition of slippage.</p>
<h1 id="common-background-check-data-sources-in-insurance">Common
Background-Check Data Sources in Insurance</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) Checks</strong> for driving
history</li>
<li><strong>Criminal Record Reports</strong> from public or private
databases</li>
<li><strong>Credit Bureau / Public Records</strong> services (e.g.,
LexisNexis, TransUnion, Experian)</li>
<li><strong>Other Specialized Tools</strong> (e.g., TLOxp, Accurint)
that aggregate court records, address histories, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="mib">MIB</h1>
<p><strong>MIB</strong> (formerly known as the Medical Information
Bureau) is a member-owned corporation composed of hundreds of life and
health insurance companies in the United States and Canada. It’s
designed to help insurers <strong>exchange information about individual
applicants</strong> in an effort to prevent fraud and ensure more
accurate underwriting decisions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-mib-works">How MIB Works</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Collection (Coding System)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you apply for life or health insurance, the insurance carrier’s
underwriter may request your authorization to check your MIB file (if
one exists).</li>
<li>If, during underwriting, the insurer discovers health conditions or
other pertinent data (through your application, medical exams, or
third-party reports), they may transmit a coded summary of that
information to MIB.</li>
<li>These <strong>MIB “codes”</strong> are broad indicators of health
conditions or lifestyle risks (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes,
smoking habits). They do <em>not</em> include the full medical record,
just the summarized risk codes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Applicant Authorization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with privacy regulations, insurers can’t access or report
to MIB without your consent (usually given via the insurance
application’s consent forms).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Use by Other Insurers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a different insurer underwrites a new policy for you, they can
check MIB’s database. If your MIB file has codes, it prompts
underwriters to investigate those potential health issues or red flags
more closely.</li>
<li><em>Important</em>: Each insurer still must conduct its own
underwriting process. MIB codes simply serve as
clues—<strong>not</strong> definitive medical evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consumer Rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can request your own MIB report once a year, free of charge. If
there are inaccuracies, you can dispute them and have corrections
made.</li>
<li>To request your file, go to the MIB’s website or call their
toll-free number.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MIB typically retains data for a limited period—usually about
<strong>7 years</strong> from the date it’s reported, although that can
vary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-mib-matters">Why MIB Matters</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MIB helps uncover situations where an applicant might
<strong>omit</strong> or <strong>misrepresent</strong> critical
information (e.g., denying a past diagnosis). If there’s an MIB code
noting a particular condition, the new insurer knows to investigate
further.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Underwriting Efficiency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It streamlines the underwriting process by giving insurers a quick
reference to possible conditions or lifestyle risks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fairer Premiums</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reducing the likelihood of undetected high-risk applicants being
classified as low-risk, premiums stay more equitable across the pool of
insureds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MIB</strong> is not a giant database of detailed medical
records; it’s a system of <strong>codes</strong> that signal certain
conditions or concerns.</li>
<li>It’s <strong>only</strong> accessible by member insurers and only
with the applicant’s explicit authorization.</li>
<li>Consumers have the right to view and correct any information about
themselves in the MIB database.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, MIB is a central resource helping insurance companies
verify application information and maintain underwriting integrity,
while also giving consumers the ability to check and dispute their own
records.</p>
<h1 id="measuring-slippage">Measuring Slippage</h1>
<p>Measuring <strong>underwriting slippage</strong>—particularly the
kind where some applicants are given a more favorable risk class than
they truly deserve—can indeed be approached by creating a
<strong>controlled or “hold-out” sample</strong> for deeper scrutiny.
Below is a framework showing how insurers often do this when comparing
<strong>traditional</strong> underwriting to
<strong>accelerated</strong> underwriting (AU):</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="outline-of-a-random-hold-out-method">1. Outline of a “Random
Hold-Out” Method</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Random Assignment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You take a <strong>random subset</strong> of applicants (e.g., 1/5
or 10%—whatever size is statistically viable) who qualify for the
accelerated underwriting process.</li>
<li>These applicants are then <strong>also</strong> subjected to
<strong>full/traditional underwriting</strong> (paramed exams, labs, APS
[Attending Physician Statement], etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dual Underwriting for the Hold-Out Group</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong> Approach: The applicant
goes through your automated or streamlined approach, possibly based on
predictive models, MIB, RX checks, credit data, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Underwriting</strong> Approach: The same
applicant’s file is fully underwritten in parallel (or shortly after),
allowing you to see how a full medical exam and deeper manual review
might classify them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Compare Classifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the hold-out group, <strong>compare</strong> the risk class
assigned by AU (e.g., Preferred, Standard) versus the risk class from
full underwriting.</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: Out of 100 hold-out applicants, maybe 10 were
classed as “Preferred” by AU but end up as “Standard” or “Substandard”
under traditional underwriting. This difference is your “slippage”—i.e.,
how often you’re undercharging premium.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze and Quantify the Gap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incidence of Misclassification</strong>: The percentage of
applicants for whom the AU class is more favorable (or less favorable)
than the traditional class.</li>
<li><strong>Severity of Misclassification</strong>: How big is the jump?
Preferred → Standard is less severe than Preferred → Substandard with a
significant premium differential.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Impact</strong>: Actuaries can then model how that
misclassification rate translates into potential <strong>mortality or
morbidity losses</strong> over the life of the policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Refine AU Criteria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the insights from the hold-out analysis to recalibrate your
accelerated underwriting rules or thresholds.</li>
<li>If too many high-risk applicants are sliding into Preferred rates,
you might tighten credit score cutoffs, tweak prescription scoring
rules, or require more frequent verification for certain health
conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="practical-considerations">2. Practical Considerations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Sample Size &amp; Statistical Power</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You want a big enough hold-out sample to be <strong>statistically
representative</strong>. The goal is to detect differences in
classification rates and gather meaningful data on mortality/morbidity
experience (over time).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing &amp; Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full underwriting is costlier (lab tests, medical exams, APS
retrieval, etc.). Insurers must weigh this against the value of
identifying slippage.</li>
<li>The additional time for full underwriting can also slow the
applicant’s process, so you’ll want to manage expectations and possibly
incentivize participants if it’s part of a pilot program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Validation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial classification differences give an <strong>immediate
measure</strong> of potential slippage.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate “proof”</strong> comes from longer-term claims or
mortality studies. Over several policy years, you see if the accelerated
group’s <strong>actual loss ratio</strong> or <strong>mortality</strong>
is higher than priced for.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Disclosure Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some jurisdictions, you need explicit disclosure if you’re
subjecting applicants to additional underwriting steps for a “study”
versus the standard approach.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary">3. Summary</h2>
<p>Yes—running a <strong>random hold-out study</strong> is a standard,
defensible way to <strong>measure and validate slippage</strong> in an
accelerated underwriting program:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>randomly select</strong> a subset of applicants who are
eligible for AU.</li>
<li><strong>Dual underwrite</strong> them (both AU and full/traditional)
to see if the results diverge.</li>
<li><strong>Measure how often</strong> (and by how much) the AU program
issues too-favorable classifications.</li>
<li><strong>Calibrate</strong> or tweak your accelerated model
accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This empirical method gives you the best real-world evidence of
whether your accelerated approach is systematically missing key risks or
not. By repeating this analysis periodically (or continuously, on a
small sample), you maintain ongoing quality control and keep
slippage—and the associated financial risk—at acceptable levels.</p>

<p>In the context of <strong>life insurance underwriting</strong>,
you’ll most often hear about Milliman in connection with
<strong>underwriting guidelines</strong> (sometimes called “Milliman
Manuals”) or <strong>IntelliScript</strong> (for checking an applicant’s
prescription drug history). These resources assist underwriters in
making more informed decisions, reducing misclassification, and
streamlining the overall underwriting process.</p>
<h1 id="protective-value">Protective Value</h1>
<p>You might be referring to what the industry more commonly calls
<strong>“protective value”</strong> (occasionally people say “protected
value”) of an underwriting requirement. This concept involves measuring
the <em>net benefit</em> of a particular underwriting test or piece of
evidence—such as a lab test, paramed exam, credit check, or APS
(Attending Physician Statement)—relative to its cost and impact on the
underwriting process.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-protective-value">What Is “Protective Value”?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: The amount of mortality or morbidity
savings an underwriting requirement provides, <em>net</em> of the cost
and any friction (e.g., time, consumer drop-off) it adds to the new
business process.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Determine whether the additional insight into
an applicant’s true risk justifies the cost and complexity of collecting
that requirement.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="example-of-protective-value-analysis">Example of Protective
Value Analysis</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Requirement</strong>: Let’s say you’re evaluating the
<strong>protective value of a paramedical exam</strong> (which includes
blood pressure measurement, fluid samples, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The direct expense of the paramed exam (nurses, kits, lab
fees).</li>
<li>Indirect costs, such as increased cycle time for policy issuance and
potential applicant drop-off because of inconvenience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mortality Reduction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By having paramed results (e.g., elevated blood pressure, abnormal
labs), the insurer might reclassify an applicant from “Preferred” down
to “Standard” or “Substandard,” thereby collecting higher premiums to
offset the higher risk.</li>
<li>Over many policies, this reclassification <em>reduces</em> the
insurer’s overall mortality losses (because they aren’t inadvertently
underpricing risk).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Net Benefit</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If the <strong>expected future mortality savings</strong> from more
accurate classification exceeds the <strong>total cost</strong>
(financial + process impact), the requirement is said to have a
<em>positive</em> protective value.</li>
<li>If the cost outweighs the mortality savings, the requirement may
<em>not</em> be worthwhile—or might only be worthwhile above certain
face amounts or in specific segments of the population.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-protective-value-matters">Why Protective Value Matters</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Underwriting Efficiency</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Carriers don’t want to load the underwriting process with
unnecessary requirements. Each added step can turn off potential
customers, drive up expenses, and slow down issuance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Profitability and Pricing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a requirement has strong protective value, it helps keep
misclassification (“slippage”) down and ensures the company’s pricing
assumptions hold true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Customer Experience</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Especially with <strong>accelerated underwriting</strong> programs,
companies strive to minimize invasive requirements (like fluids). A
protective value analysis ensures they only keep the steps that
meaningfully contribute to risk assessment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="tying-it-to-accelerated-underwriting-au">Tying It to Accelerated
Underwriting (AU)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional vs. Accelerated</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In an <strong>accelerated</strong> model, insurers rely on
data-driven tools (MIB, prescription history, credit, etc.) and may
waive labs/exams for healthy, lower-risk applicants—if they’re confident
in their predictive models.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Measuring Slippage</strong>:
<ul>
<li>To confirm there’s no <em>hidden</em> or <em>excessive</em>
slippage, insurers often run a <strong>controlled “hold-out”</strong>
sample. A portion of applicants who “pass” AU are also fully
underwritten to see if they’d end up in a worse risk class.</li>
<li>This helps quantify how much the accelerated approach might
misclassify people as “healthier” than they really are—<em>and</em> it
reveals the protective value of the additional tests and exams.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>“protective value”</strong> (or “protected value”) of an
underwriting requirement gauges <em>how much</em> it reduces mortality
risk (through better classification) <em>minus</em> its associated cost
and friction.</li>
<li>It’s a <strong>key concept</strong> when deciding whether to include
or waive certain traditional underwriting steps—particularly in
<strong>accelerated underwriting</strong> programs aiming to balance a
seamless customer experience with accurate risk assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="trl">TRL</h1>
<h2 id="key-points-about-truerisk-life-trl">Key Points About TrueRisk®
Life (TRL)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Credit-Based Mortality Score</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TRL analyzes a consumer’s <strong>credit history and
behaviors</strong> (e.g., payment patterns, types of credit, length of
credit history).</li>
<li>The logic behind this is that credit behavior often correlates with
various lifestyle factors and, in aggregate, can be predictive of
<strong>long-term mortality</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring Output</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The model generates a <strong>score</strong> that insurers use—on
its own or combined with traditional underwriting elements (MIB,
prescription checks, medical exams)—to help classify applicants into a
particular risk category.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with Other Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While TRL itself focuses on <strong>credit attributes</strong>,
insurers sometimes <strong>supplement</strong> it with other data sets:
<ul>
<li><strong>ZIP code</strong> (to glean socioeconomic or health
environment indicators)</li>
<li><strong>Educational attainment</strong> or other consumer marketing
variables (if permissible and relevant in a given jurisdiction)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use in Accelerated Underwriting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TRL is popular in <strong>accelerated or fluidless</strong>
underwriting programs, where companies want to reduce or eliminate lab
tests for low-risk applicants.</li>
<li>A favorable TRL score can help “fast-track” an applicant, especially
if it aligns well with their other underwriting indicators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Compliance Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because credit-based scores can be regulated differently depending
on jurisdiction, insurers must ensure that <strong>adverse action
notices</strong> and other compliance requirements are in place.</li>
<li>In the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) typically applies
if a life insurer is using a credit-based model for underwriting
decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="does-trl-use-zip-codes-or-education-directly">Does TRL Use ZIP
Codes or Education Directly?</h3>
<ul>
<li>By default, <strong>TransUnion’s TRL</strong> is described as a
<strong>credit-based</strong> risk model rather than one that explicitly
integrates demographic details such as ZIP code or education.</li>
<li><strong>However</strong>, many insurers build their own
<strong>composite models</strong> or underwriting workflows that pair
TRL with other data sources—some of which might incorporate demographics
or “lifestyle” data (like known income proxies, educational levels, or
ZIP code–based risk scores).</li>
<li>The exact implementation varies by insurance carrier and their data
vendors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<ul>
<li>The predictive model known as <strong>“TRL”</strong> in the life
insurance industry is <strong>TransUnion’s TrueRisk® Life</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s primarily derived from <strong>credit data</strong>, but may be
combined with <strong>ZIP code, education, or other socio-demographic
factors</strong>—depending on the insurer’s overall underwriting
strategy.</li>
<li>Its core purpose is to <strong>predict mortality risk</strong> and
help insurers expedite underwriting for certain applicants.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="oft">OFT</h1>
<p>While there isn’t a single, universally recognized meaning of “OFT”
across all insurers, one <strong>common usage</strong> in the life
insurance underwriting context is:</p>
<h3 id="oft-oral-fluid-testing"><strong>OFT = Oral Fluid
Testing</strong></h3>
<p>This refers to saliva-based testing used by some carriers as an
alternative or supplement to traditional blood and urine exams. Here’s
more detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>What Is Oral Fluid Testing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It involves collecting a saliva sample (often via a swab inside the
cheek) instead of drawing blood or requiring a urine sample.</li>
<li>These samples can be tested for various markers—e.g.,
nicotine/cotinine (for tobacco use), certain drugs, and sometimes HIV
antibodies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Why Do Insurers Use OFT?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less Invasive</strong>: Some applicants are more willing to
do a quick cheek swab than undergo a blood draw or provide a urine
sample.</li>
<li><strong>Faster and More Convenient</strong>: Saliva collection can
be done at home or in an office setting with minimal equipment and fewer
logistical challenges (e.g., no phlebotomist needed).</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated Underwriting</strong>: Oral Fluid Testing can be
part of a streamlined underwriting process for lower face amounts or
younger, healthier applicants, reducing the need for a full paramed
exam.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations / Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope of Testing</strong>: Saliva tests can’t always measure
the same range of biomarkers or provide the same depth of information as
blood/urine tests.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy/Detection Window</strong>: The detection window for
certain substances might be shorter, and environmental factors (e.g.,
recent eating or drinking) can affect results.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="could-oft-mean-something-else">Could OFT Mean Something
Else?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OFT</strong> could also be an internal shorthand at a
specific insurer (or vendor) for a particular process or tool (e.g.,
<em>“Online Fulfillment Tool,”</em> <em>“Optimal Field Triage,”</em>
etc.).</li>
<li>In <strong>most</strong> references to “OFT” in underwriting
materials, however, it’s typically “<strong>Oral Fluid
Testing</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve encountered “OFT” in documents, training, or discussions
about minimizing invasive requirements or comparing fluid tests, it
almost certainly refers to <strong>Oral Fluid Testing</strong>. If in
doubt, check your carrier’s underwriting guidelines or ask your
underwriting support team—they can confirm the exact usage in your
organization.</p>
