<h2 id="revised-draft">2. Revised Draft</h2>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Leading tech companies like Microsoft and Google are introducing a new
type of product known as Generative Search Engines (or “Generative
Engines”). These tools combine traditional web search with the
summarization power of Large Language Models (LLMs). When users submit a
question to a Generative Engine, the answer is created by summarizing
and citing content discovered through conventional search.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong><br />
Being cited by a Generative Engine boosts a company’s visibility, brand
awareness, and credibility. In a competitive market, higher visibility
translates into stronger marketing reach and more potential customers.
As these engines become more popular, it is only natural that companies
will want to ensure they are featured prominently in AI-generated
summaries.</p>
<p><strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong><br />
We use the term <em>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</em> to
describe methods that help a company’s website appear in answers
generated by LLMs. It differs from traditional Search Engine
Optimization (SEO). While SEO focuses on improving rankings in search
results, GEO targets how well a Generative Engine summarizes and cites a
website’s content.</p>
<p><strong>Our Project</strong><br />
We anticipate that Generative Engines will rapidly gain traction. To
prepare, we built a custom Generative Engine to evaluate our company’s
website content. Our findings revealed opportunities for improvement.
For instance, when we asked “What products are offered by [our
company]?”, our website ranked fourth out of several sources. This
suggests that three other sites provided clearer or more authoritative
information on our products.</p>
<p>Next, we experimented with changes to our website content to see if
we could raise our standing in the Generative Engine’s summarized
results. By making targeted adjustments, we increased our site’s
visibility by <strong>154%</strong> for that specific question.</p>
<p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>A Measurement Framework</strong><br />
We have developed a method to gauge how effectively our website answers
life insurance questions compared to competing sites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Testing Methodology</strong><br />
Using the same framework, we can measure the impact of content updates
and ensure they improve our site’s standing within Generative
Engines.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-Cost, High ROI</strong>: Our approach relies on publicly
accessible information and straightforward testing strategies, resulting
in minimal additional expense.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Use of LLMs</strong>: We only submit data that is
already publicly available, so there are no privacy or security
risks.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proof Strategy</strong>: As Generative Engines become
more widespread, our company is positioned to “get in on the ground
floor” and stay ahead of the competition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
We believe that investing in Generative Engine Optimization now will
yield significant benefits as LLM-based search grows in popularity. Our
framework and testing methodology can help our company strengthen its
online presence, boost brand credibility, and capture more public
attention—all while maintaining a cost-effective, low-risk approach to
leveraging AI technologies.</p>
