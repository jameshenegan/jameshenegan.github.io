  <body><h1 id="geo">GEO</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed search
engines, leading to the creation of “generative engines” (GEs) that use
these models to directly generate and summarize responses to user
queries. Unlike traditional search engines that rely on showing links to
external websites, generative engines compile and synthesize information
from multiple sources to provide a cohesive answer. This shift has made
search engines more useful to users, offering faster, often more
personalized responses, but it also presents a challenge to content
creators, whose work may be used by these engines without much
transparency or control over how it appears in the responses.</p>
<p>To support content creators within this new system, a new approach
called <strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong> has been
introduced. GEO offers a framework to help content creators improve the
chances that their content will be featured in generative engine
responses, despite the black-box nature of these models. This
optimization strategy allows creators to focus on increasing the
visibility of their content through customizable visibility metrics,
despite limited direct control over generative engine behavior.</p>
<p>A benchmark, <strong>GEO-bench</strong>, has been developed to
evaluate the effectiveness of GEO. GEO-bench includes a large set of
diverse user queries spanning multiple topics and sources, allowing a
structured way to assess visibility improvements. Initial evaluations
show that GEO can enhance content visibility in generative engine
responses by as much as 40%. Additionally, GEO’s effectiveness varies
across different types of content, suggesting that tailored strategies
are needed for different domains.</p>
<p>This research highlights a new direction in the development of search
technology and information accessibility, with significant implications
for both the creators of generative engines and content providers.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Traditional search engines, invented around 30 years ago, transformed
global information access by providing lists of relevant websites in
response to user queries. However, these engines were limited in that
they only pointed users toward information rather than providing answers
directly. The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as those in
tools like BingChat, Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE), and
perplexity.ai, has now led to the development of “generative engines”
(GEs). These new systems blend traditional search with generative models
to gather and synthesize information from multiple sources, offering
comprehensive, multi-faceted responses rather than just lists of
links.</p>
<p>Generative engines bring significant benefits to users by delivering
information faster and more accurately and to developers by improving
engagement and satisfaction. However, they present a challenge for
content creators. Unlike traditional search engines, generative engines
reduce users’ need to visit websites, potentially lowering organic
traffic and impacting creators who rely on site visits for revenue and
visibility. Additionally, the proprietary and opaque nature of GEs
leaves content creators with little insight or control over how their
content is used or displayed.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, the authors introduce <strong>Generative
Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong>, a novel framework designed to help
content creators adapt their content for generative engines. GEO uses a
flexible, black-box optimization approach to improve the visibility of
web content in generative responses. By adjusting content presentation,
style, and structure, GEO aims to enhance a website’s chances of being
cited or included in generative responses.</p>
<p>One of GEO’s key innovations is its visibility metrics, which go
beyond traditional rankings to measure visibility across dimensions like
citation placement, relevance, and influence within the response. Since
generative engines use complex, structured outputs, these new metrics
are necessary for assessing visibility more accurately than traditional
search engines, which simply rank results linearly.</p>
<p>To test GEO’s effectiveness, the authors developed
<strong>GEO-bench</strong>, a large benchmark containing 10,000 queries
across various domains. Evaluations of GEO’s methods show visibility
improvements of up to 40% across different queries, with strategies like
including citations, quotations, and relevant statistics significantly
boosting a source’s presence in generative responses. Real-world tests
on platforms like Perplexity.ai confirmed these gains, demonstrating a
37% improvement in content visibility.</p>
<p>In summary, the contributions of this work are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong>: The first
optimization framework for improving content visibility in generative
engines, with up to a 40% boost in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Customized Visibility Metrics</strong>: GEO introduces a new
set of visibility metrics tailored to generative engine requirements,
allowing creators to optimize content with precision.</li>
<li><strong>GEO-bench Benchmark</strong>: The first large-scale, diverse
benchmark for evaluating content optimization techniques specifically
for generative engines, supporting rigorous testing and
improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>This work provides an essential toolset for content creators adapting
to the generative search landscape and marks an advancement in
optimizing for information discovery in the era of generative AI.</p>
<h2 id="formulation-and-methodology">Formulation and Methodology</h2>
<p><strong>2.1 Formulation of Generative Engines (GEs):</strong></p>
<p>Generative engines (GEs) are advanced search systems that combine
traditional search functions with generative language models. They work
by retrieving relevant documents from the web (or a database) and using
AI models to generate a summarized response, complete with inline
citations. Unlike traditional search engines, which display a ranked
list of websites, GEs synthesize content from multiple sources into a
structured answer. This structure presents challenges in defining and
measuring visibility (or “impression”) because GEs do not just list
results but instead embed citations within a response, intermixing
various sources.</p>
<p>A typical GE workflow involves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Breaking down the user’s query into smaller sub-queries.</li>
<li>Sending these to a search engine to retrieve sources.</li>
<li>Summarizing each source.</li>
<li>Combining summaries into a cohesive response.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is illustrated by a setup resembling BingChat, which
splits a complex query into simpler parts, retrieves relevant sources,
summarizes them, and integrates these summaries into a structured
response. Since GEs aim to be accurate and avoid misinformation, every
fact in the response ideally links to a supporting source.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):</strong></p>
<p>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is proposed as a new framework
to help content creators increase their visibility within GE responses.
Traditional SEO strategies aren’t effective with GEs because GEs
generate responses based on a more nuanced understanding of language and
meaning rather than simple keyword matching. GEO is designed to maximize
a website’s impression by ensuring it is frequently and prominently
cited within responses. This visibility depends on relevance to the
query and placement within the answer.</p>
<p><strong>2.2.1 Defining Impressions for Generative
Engines:</strong></p>
<p>Since visibility metrics from traditional search engines don’t fit
well with GEs, GEO introduces new “impression” metrics tailored to these
systems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Word Count Impression</strong>: Measures the prominence of a
source by the number of words from a citation in the response. A higher
word count indicates greater prominence.</li>
<li><strong>Position-Adjusted Word Count</strong>: Weights citations
more heavily if they appear earlier in the response since users are
likelier to read the beginning of an answer.</li>
<li><strong>Subjective Impression Metric</strong>: Considers subjective
factors like relevance, citation influence, and material uniqueness. It
uses a tool called G-Eval to evaluate the quality of these subjective
metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.2.2 GEO Methods for Websites:</strong></p>
<p>To optimize content for GE visibility, GEO offers several strategies
that help improve how often and prominently a website is cited:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Authoritative Style</strong>: Makes text sound more
convincing.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics Addition</strong>: Adds quantitative data for
clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Keyword Inclusion</strong>: Incorporates query-relevant
keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Citing Sources and Adding Quotations</strong>: Increases
credibility by citing trusted sources.</li>
<li><strong>Easy-to-Understand Language</strong>: Simplifies complex
language for better comprehension.</li>
<li><strong>Fluency Optimization</strong>: Ensures text flows
naturally.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Terms</strong>: Uses specific or technical terms to
stand out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most methods enhance existing content presentation, while a few (like
adding sources and quotations) may require additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Testing GEO Methods:</strong></p>
<p>The effectiveness of each method is tested by applying them
individually to website content in response to a query and evaluating
the improvements in visibility metrics. Each GEO method, therefore, aims
to make website content more compatible with generative engine
requirements, improving the chances of being cited within AI-generated
responses.</p>
<p>In essence, GEO offers a range of techniques for content creators to
boost visibility in a world where generative engines, not traditional
search engines, may increasingly control the flow of information.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2>
<h3 id="summary-and-explanation">Summary and Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Evaluated Generative Engine:</strong> This experimental
setup mimics common commercial generative engines (like You.com and
Perplexity.ai) by using a two-step process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Retrieving the top 5 most relevant sources from Google for each
query.</li>
<li>Using an AI language model (specifically GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate
responses based on these sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of only the top 5 sources helps manage limitations in
processing power and cost when working with large language models. Each
query receives multiple generated responses, reducing variability in the
results.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Benchmark: GEO-bench</strong> To evaluate the
effectiveness of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) methods, the
GEO-bench dataset was created. This benchmark includes 10,000 diverse
queries, categorized by topic, complexity, and user intent, providing a
robust test environment for assessing GEO methods.</p>
<p>The queries in GEO-bench are drawn from nine sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MS Macro, ORCAS-1, Natural Questions</strong>: Represent
general user queries from search engines.</li>
<li><strong>All Souls, LIMA</strong>: Include complex questions
requiring reasoning and aggregation of information.</li>
<li><strong>Davinci-Debate</strong>: Questions designed to test debate
and reasoning skills.</li>
<li><strong>Perplexity.ai Discover, ELI-5</strong>: Complex questions
from Perplexity.ai and Reddit that require simplified explanations.</li>
<li><strong>GPT-4 Generated Queries</strong>: A diverse set of synthetic
queries across different domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each query in GEO-bench is associated with the top 5 Google search
results, allowing for a thorough test of how well GEO methods enhance
content visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Tags in GEO-bench:</strong> Each query is tagged by category
(like Arts, Health, Games), user intent (informational, transactional,
navigational), and complexity. This tagging helps content creators
select the right GEO method based on the nature of the query, allowing
for more targeted optimization.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 GEO Methods</strong> Nine GEO methods are tested, each
aimed at improving different aspects of content visibility within
generative engine responses. These methods include tactics like adding
authoritative language, including statistics, simplifying language, and
quoting sources. Each method’s effectiveness is compared to a baseline
(unmodified content), and results are averaged to minimize
randomness.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Evaluation Metrics</strong> Two main metrics are used to
assess GEO method performance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Position-Adjusted Word Count</strong>: Measures visibility
based on both word count and citation position, giving greater weight to
sources that appear earlier in the response.</li>
<li><strong>Subjective Impression</strong>: Measures a source’s
relevance and influence within the response, as well as its uniqueness,
diversity, position, and click likelihood. This is further broken into
sub-metrics to capture different factors that may impact user attention
and engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>To standardize these metrics, they are normalized so that all
citation impressions in a response add up to 1. The relative improvement
in visibility is calculated by comparing the baseline impression with
the improved impression after applying GEO methods.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Results</strong> The study shows that traditional
SEO techniques, like keyword stuffing, perform poorly in generative
engines. In contrast, methods such as <strong>Quotation
Addition</strong> and <strong>Statistics Addition</strong> yield
substantial improvements, increasing visibility by up to 41% in
Position-Adjusted Word Count and by 28% in Subjective Impression. This
indicates that content enhancements focusing on authoritative
information and direct citations are more effective for improving
visibility within generative engines.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="summary-and-explanation-1">Summary and Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>4. Results Overview</strong> This study evaluated various
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) methods designed to improve website
visibility in Generative Engine (GE) responses. By testing these methods
on GEO-bench, a diverse set of user queries, the researchers measured
performance using two metrics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Position-Adjusted Word Count</strong>: Considers both the
word count and the citation’s position in a GE’s response.</li>
<li><strong>Subjective Impression</strong>: Combines several subjective
factors like relevance, credibility, and uniqueness to create an overall
impression score.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong> The results indicate that GEO methods
consistently outperform the baseline (no optimization) across these
metrics, demonstrating their robustness across various types of queries.
Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top-performing methods</strong>: The “Cite Sources,”
“Quotation Addition,” and “Statistics Addition” methods yielded the
highest visibility gains. These methods, which involve adding relevant
statistics, credible quotes, and reliable citations, achieved:
<ul>
<li>30-40% improvement on the Position-Adjusted Word Count metric.</li>
<li>15-30% improvement on the Subjective Impression metric.</li>
<li>These techniques enhance both the content’s credibility and the
richness of the information, requiring only minor adjustments to
existing content.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effectiveness Based on Search Rank</strong> The study found
that GEO methods are especially helpful for content from lower-ranked
websites in traditional search results. For instance, when using “Cite
Sources” and “Quotation Addition” methods, visibility increased
significantly for content that wasn’t initially highly ranked in search
engines, thus providing a path for less prominent websites to gain
visibility in GE responses.</p>
<p><strong>Top-performing Tags by GEO Method</strong> Each GEO method
performs well in specific content categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authoritative Style</strong>: Effective for categories like
Debate, History, and Science.</li>
<li><strong>Fluency Optimization</strong>: Beneficial in Business,
Science, and Health.</li>
<li><strong>Cite Sources</strong>: Works best in fact-based or legal
content.</li>
<li><strong>Quotation Addition</strong>: Effective in People &amp;
Society, Explanation, and History.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics Addition</strong>: Valuable in Law &amp;
Government, Debate, and Opinion content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings suggest that content creators can tailor their
optimization strategies based on their website’s target domain for
maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Stylistic Changes and Presentation</strong> Improving
readability and fluency in the text (Fluency Optimization and
Easy-to-Understand methods) also boosted visibility by 15-30%,
highlighting that GE responses value not just factual content but also
how well information is presented. This suggests that GEs prioritize
content that is clear, well-organized, and easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword Stuffing and Authoritative Tone</strong> Traditional
SEO tactics like keyword stuffing proved ineffective in GEs, offering
little to no improvement in visibility. Additionally, adding a more
persuasive or authoritative tone did not significantly boost visibility,
indicating that GEs already have built-in mechanisms to assess content
quality without requiring overt stylistic changes.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These results show that optimization strategies effective for
traditional search engines may not work as well in Generative Engines.
Instead, focusing on content credibility, presentation, and adding
authoritative sources or statistics are more effective ways to increase
visibility. For content creators, this suggests a shift from traditional
SEO techniques to those that align more closely with the nuanced
evaluation methods of GEs, helping ensure their content remains visible
and valuable in this new search paradigm.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="summary-and-explanation-2">Summary and Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>5.1 Domain-Specific Generative Engine Optimizations</strong>
This section highlights that certain Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO) methods are more effective in specific content domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authoritative Tone</strong>: Effective for debate-style and
historical content, where a persuasive writing style can enhance
credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Cite Sources</strong>: Particularly useful for factual
content, as citations validate the facts and improve the credibility of
the response.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics Addition</strong>: Works best in fields like Law
&amp; Government and Opinion content, where data-driven evidence can
increase the authority and visibility of the content.</li>
<li><strong>Quotation Addition</strong>: Most effective in domains like
People &amp; Society, Explanation, and History, as quotes add
authenticity and depth, enhancing visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>This analysis suggests that website owners should make targeted,
domain-specific optimizations to improve their visibility on generative
engines.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Optimization of Multiple Websites</strong> The study also
examined how GEO methods affect the visibility of websites across
different search rankings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower-ranked websites</strong> benefit more from GEO because
they are typically disadvantaged in traditional search rankings due to
factors like limited backlinks. GEO can improve their visibility in
Generative Engine responses, offering them a fairer playing field.</li>
<li>For instance, using “Cite Sources” increased the visibility of
fifth-ranked websites by 115.1%, while top-ranked websites saw a
decrease in visibility by 30.3% when GEO methods were applied across all
content sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that GEO methods could help democratize online visibility,
offering smaller websites a chance to compete effectively against larger
ones in Generative Engine responses.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Combination of GEO Strategies</strong> Combining GEO
strategies generally yields better results than using them individually.
The analysis of strategy combinations showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluency Optimization and Statistics Addition</strong>
together produced the highest visibility improvements, outperforming
individual strategies by over 5.5%.</li>
<li><strong>Cite Sources</strong> also performed well in combination
with other strategies, boosting visibility significantly, even though it
was less effective alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that content creators can achieve optimal results by
combining multiple GEO methods tailored to their content.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Qualitative Analysis</strong> Examples in this section
illustrate how GEO methods improve visibility with minimal changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a citation source significantly increases visibility, as seen
in a query about Swiss chocolate, where citing a study on chocolate
consumption boosted the content’s credibility.</li>
<li>Incorporating relevant statistics, like mentioning a 70% increase in
robotic involvement, makes content more authoritative and
informative.</li>
<li>Enhancing the tone (e.g., using a more persuasive or impactful
style) also improves visibility, especially in responses that require a
clear stance or opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples show that even minor adjustments, such as citing
credible sources or adding statistics, can substantially improve
visibility in Generative Engine responses without extensive content
changes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This analysis highlights the importance of domain-specific and
combined GEO strategies in improving visibility on Generative Engines.
Small content creators and lower-ranked websites can especially benefit,
making GEO an effective approach to leveling the digital playing field.
Content creators are encouraged to experiment with multiple GEO
strategies and tailor them to their content domains for the best results
in Generative Engine responses.</p>
<h3 id="summary-and-explanation-3">Summary and Explanation</h3>
<p><strong>6. GEO in the Wild: Testing on Perplexity.ai</strong> The GEO
methods were tested on Perplexity.ai, a widely-used generative engine,
to confirm their real-world effectiveness. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quotation Addition</strong> improved visibility the most,
with a 22% increase in Position-Adjusted Word Count over the baseline,
indicating that citing quotes from credible sources is particularly
effective.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics Addition</strong> also boosted visibility by 37%,
while traditional SEO methods like <strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong>
underperformed, showing 10% less effectiveness than the baseline.</li>
</ul>
<p>These results underscore three main points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The effectiveness of domain-specific GEO methods in real-world
applications.</li>
<li>The adaptability of GEO methods across various generative
engines.</li>
<li>The practicality of GEO methods for content creators, as they can
easily implement them to improve visibility.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7. Related Work</strong> This work builds on previous
research in evidence-backed answer generation, where models use sources
to generate responses. While past methods focused on fetching sources or
manipulating model outputs, GEO introduces non-adversarial strategies
that optimize content for generative engines.</p>
<p>Additionally, GEO differs from traditional <strong>Search Engine
Optimization (SEO)</strong> as it involves optimizing for generative
models rather than keyword-based ranking. GEO considers multi-modal
outputs, conversational structures, and varied query reformulation,
necessitating different strategies than standard SEO.</p>
<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong> This research introduces the concept
of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), which allows content creators
to enhance their content’s visibility in generative engine results. Key
contributions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GEO-bench</strong>: A benchmark dataset of diverse queries
with sources for evaluating GEO methods.</li>
<li><strong>Effective GEO Methods</strong>: Techniques like adding
citations, statistics, and quotations were shown to increase visibility
by up to 40%.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Application</strong>: Testing on a real
generative engine (Perplexity.ai) demonstrated the high real-world
impact of GEO methods, especially for small creators and lower-ranked
sites, by making visibility improvements accessible without relying on
traditional SEO factors like backlinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The research formalizes GEO as a new paradigm, offering tools,
benchmarks, and methods to enhance generative engine optimization across
various content domains.</p>
<p><strong>9. Limitations</strong> While promising, GEO has certain
limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: GEO methods might need to evolve as
generative engines change, similar to SEO’s ongoing adaptation.</li>
<li><strong>Query Evolution</strong>: GEO-bench may require updates to
stay aligned with shifting real-world query patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Search Rankings</strong>: Since GEO focuses on
text optimization rather than metadata like domain or backlinks, it’s
unclear how it affects traditional search rankings, though it likely has
minimal impact.</li>
<li><strong>Context Limitations</strong>: Larger context lengths in
future models could allow them to process more sources, potentially
diminishing the emphasis on high search rankings.</li>
</ol>
<p>In sum, GEO represents an innovative step toward helping content
creators adapt to the generative search engine landscape, with practical
implications for enhancing visibility across multiple platforms and
evolving search paradigms.</p>
