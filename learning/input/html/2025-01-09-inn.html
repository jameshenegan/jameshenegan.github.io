<p>Companies like Google and Microsoft are now offering “Generative
Engines” that combine traditional web search with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce AI-generated summaries. These summaries appear in a
prominent position on search engine results pages, pushing regular
search listings further down. Consequently, being featured in these AI
summaries has become critical for boosting visibility, brand awareness,
and credibility.</p>
<p>To help our organization adapt, we introduce Generative Engine
Optimization (GEO), which focuses on making website content more likely
to be cited and summarized by LLMs—a key difference from conventional
Search Engine Optimization (SEO). As part of our work, we developed a
custom Generative Engine to assess our own site’s performance.
Initially, our website ranked fourth when asked, “What products does
[our company] offer?”—indicating that other websites provided more
compelling explanations of our offerings. After refining an offline
version of our content, we improved our visibility by
<strong>154%</strong> for that same query.</p>
<p>Our project makes three key contributions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <strong>measurement framework</strong> that benchmarks how
effectively our content answers industry-relevant questions.</li>
<li>A <strong>testing methodology</strong> that quantifies the impact of
targeted website updates on Generative Engine results.</li>
<li>An <strong>LLM-based content generation approach</strong>, which
uses AI to create and refine website content for better GEO
performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because all data used in this process is publicly approved, there are
minimal privacy or security concerns. We believe GEO offers a low-cost,
high-impact way to stay competitive in an increasingly AI-driven search
ecosystem.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p>In today’s search landscape, major tech companies like Google and
Microsoft are rolling out “Generative Engines,” which blend traditional
web results with summaries created by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Because these AI-generated summaries occupy prime real estate at the top
of search pages, being cited in them can dramatically boost a company’s
visibility, brand awareness, and credibility.</p>
<p>We refer to strategies for improving a website’s presence in these
summaries as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Unlike traditional
SEO—where the goal is to rank higher in a list of organic results—GEO
focuses on ensuring a site’s content is effectively summarized and
referenced by LLMs. To assess how our own website performs, we built a
custom Generative Engine and discovered that we initially ranked fourth
for the query, “What products does [our company] offer?” In other words,
three other sites offered clearer or more authoritative information
about our own offerings. By refining our content in an offline
environment, we increased our visibility by <strong>154%</strong> for
that same query.</p>
<p>Our project delivers three key contributions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <strong>measurement framework</strong> that compares our website’s
answers against competing sites.</li>
<li>A <strong>testing methodology</strong> that measures how well
specific content changes improve performance in Generative Engines.</li>
<li>An <strong>LLM-driven content generation approach</strong>, where
Large Language Models create new content that can be tested and
optimized under this methodology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because all data we use is already approved for public consumption,
the process involves no privacy or security risks. Altogether, GEO
offers a cost-effective way to stay ahead in the evolving world of
AI-powered search.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><strong>Half-Page Summary (Academic Tone)</strong></p>
<p>Recent advancements by leading technology firms, including Google and
Microsoft, have given rise to “Generative Engines,” which integrate
traditional web search with the summarization capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). These AI-driven summaries occupy a prime
location within search results, displacing conventional listings.
Consequently, the prominence achieved by being cited in such summaries
has become a pivotal factor in enhancing organizational visibility,
credibility, and brand awareness.</p>
<p>To address this emerging trend, we propose a framework referred to as
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). In contrast to established Search
Engine Optimization (SEO) practices, GEO emphasizes tailoring online
content to ensure it is effectively summarized and referenced by LLMs.
As a proof of concept, we constructed a custom Generative Engine to
evaluate our company’s website performance. Notably, the site initially
ranked fourth for the query “What products does [our company]
offer?”—indicating that competing sources provided clearer or more
authoritative descriptions of our own offerings. However, after
modifying an offline version of our content, we achieved a 154% increase
in visibility for that same query.</p>
<p>This research effort culminates in two principal contributions.
First, it presents a robust framework for quantitatively assessing the
efficacy of website content relative to competing sources. Second, it
introduces a testing methodology designed to measure how targeted
content adjustments influence Generative Engine outcomes. Moreover,
because data inputs consist solely of publicly approved information, the
approach does not raise privacy or security concerns. In summary, the
proposed GEO methods are cost-effective, scalable, and strategically
align with the anticipated growth of AI-driven search technologies.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m excited to share how our Generative Engine initiative can
help us stand out in the fast-changing world of AI-driven search. Today,
Google, Microsoft, and other tech leaders use Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate summaries at the top of search result pages—pushing
traditional listings further down. By optimizing for these Generative
Engines, we can dramatically improve our visibility, strengthen our
brand, and build trust with potential customers.</p>
<p>Our approach—Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)—focuses on
tailoring website content so that LLMs cite and summarize it favorably.
To see how we measured up, we built a custom Generative Engine. One
surprising discovery was that we ranked fourth for the question, “What
products does [our company] offer?” By updating our content offline and
testing again, we increased visibility by 154% for that query alone.
Moving forward, we’ve developed a framework to compare our answers
against competitors and test new content to see what works best. This
same technology could eventually let LLMs generate fresh, GEO-friendly
webpages on our behalf, all while using publicly approved information—so
there’s no privacy risk. It’s a low-cost, high-impact approach that
keeps us ahead in an AI-driven future.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p>Leading tech companies like Microsoft and Google now offer
“Generative Engines,” which blend traditional web search with the
summarizing power of Large Language Models (LLMs). These AI-generated
summaries appear first on results pages, pushing conventional search
listings further down. As a result, being cited by a Generative Engine
can dramatically boost a company’s visibility, brand awareness, and
credibility.</p>
<p>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) involves fine-tuning a website
so that Generative Engines both cite and summarize its content
effectively—an approach that differs significantly from traditional SEO.
To anticipate this shift, we built a custom Generative Engine to assess
how well our company’s website is represented in AI-driven summaries. In
one test, our site ranked fourth when users asked, “What products are
offered by [our company]?” Three other sites were more authoritative or
clearer about our own products. By adjusting an offline version of our
content, we increased our visibility by 154% for that query.</p>
<p>We now offer a measurement framework to evaluate the quality of our
website’s answers versus competing sites, along with a testing
methodology to gauge the impact of content updates. Our work also lays
the groundwork for leveraging LLMs to generate or refine content,
ensuring it is GEO-friendly. Overall, this initiative is low-cost, poses
no privacy risks, and positions the company at the forefront of a
rapidly evolving online landscape.</p>
<p>Below is a revised, streamlined version that maintains the original
structure and emphasis while clarifying and refining the language and
style.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Leading tech companies like Microsoft and Google are introducing a
new type of product known as Generative Search Engines (or “Generative
Engines”). These tools combine traditional web search with the
summarization power of Large Language Models (LLMs). When users submit a
query to a search engine such as Google or Bing—which now integrate
Generative Engines—the answer is produced by summarizing and citing
content discovered through conventional search.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Google and Bing showcase their AI-generated summaries at the top of
the search engine results page, with traditional results appearing
below. This prime placement increases visibility for companies
referenced in those summaries, enhancing brand awareness and
credibility. In a competitive market, higher visibility translates into
stronger marketing reach and more potential customers. As these engines
gain popularity, it is only natural that companies will want to ensure
they appear prominently in AI-driven results.</p>
<h2 id="generative-engine-optimization-geo">Generative Engine
Optimization (GEO)</h2>
<p>We use the term <em>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</em> to
describe strategies that help a company’s website appear in answers
generated by LLMs. Unlike traditional Search Engine Optimization
(SEO)—which focuses on climbing the list of organic search results—GEO
centers on how effectively a Generative Engine cites and summarizes a
website’s content. Conventional SEO techniques do little to improve
AI-generated summaries.</p>
<h2 id="our-project">Our Project</h2>
<p>To prepare for the rapid rise of Generative Engines, we developed a
custom Generative Engine to evaluate our company’s website content. Our
findings revealed opportunities for improvement. For example, when we
asked, “What products are offered by [our company]?”, our site ranked
fourth among several sources—indicating that three other websites
presented clearer or more authoritative information on our own
products.</p>
<p>Next, we made targeted changes to an offline version of our website
content to see if we could improve our visibility within the Generative
Engine’s summarized results. By fine-tuning the information presented,
we boosted our site’s visibility by <strong>154%</strong> for that
specific question.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-offer">What We Offer</h2>
