Language Models (LLMs) and Their Role in the Livingston Labs Innovation
Day Project</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a relatively new type of technology
that play a significant role in our Innovation Day project. Before
giving our main presentation, we thought it would be helpful to spend
some time clarifying how LLMs work and how we are using them in this
project.</p>
<h3 id="the-relationship-between-llms-and-chatgpt">The Relationship
Between LLMs and ChatGPT</h3>
<p>When you hear the term “large language model,” it’s natural to think
of something like ChatGPT. However, one key point is that ChatGPT itself
is not <strong>just</strong> a large language model. ChatGPT is a web
application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with
a family of large language models (for example, GPT-4, GPT-4 Mini,
etc.).</p>
<p>In other words, ChatGPT consists of both:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A front end</strong> – the user interface that makes it feel
like a chatbot or conversation window.</li>
<li><strong>A back end</strong> – the actual large language models that
process and generate responses.</li>
</ol>
<p>This conversational, back-and-forth style is only one use case for
large language models—albeit a complex one that has garnered a lot of
public interest.</p>
<h3 id="other-use-cases-for-large-language-models">Other Use Cases for
Large Language Models</h3>
<p>Beyond conversation, there are many other tasks LLMs can handle.
Unlike a multi-turn chat, these tasks can sometimes be accomplished in a
single “request → response” flow. Two examples include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Text Summarization</strong><br />
LLMs can summarize large amounts of text. A typical prompt might
be:<br />
<em>“Please summarize the following text:”</em><br />
followed by the text to be summarized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question-Related Retrieval</strong><br />
In this scenario, the LLM answers a specific question using information
you provide. A prompt might look like:<br />
*“You will be provided with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A question</li>
<li>Information that can be used to answer that question.<br />
Please answer the question using only the information provided.”*</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-we-are-using-llms-in-our-project">How We Are Using LLMs in
Our Project</h3>
<p>Our project focuses less on “chatting” with an LLM and more on tasks
resembling a single request-and-response interaction. Because of this,
we don’t need to rely on a web application interface; instead, we can
send requests directly to a large language model via an API.</p>
<p>In particular, we are interested in <strong>question-related
retrieval</strong>—having an LLM answer questions accurately by using a
specific body of information. This approach aligns more closely with our
project goals than simply conducting open-ended conversations with a
large language model.</p>
