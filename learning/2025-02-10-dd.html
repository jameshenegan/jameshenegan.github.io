<h2 id="refine-the-problem-statement-and-scope">1. Refine the Problem
Statement and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet with your manager(s) this week</strong> to confirm what
“success” looks like at the end of the 10-week project.</li>
<li>Identify the <strong>key questions</strong> you need answered before
moving forward (e.g., “Do we need specific tool recommendations, or just
a prototype?” “What’s the exact definition of ‘standardization’ for our
department?”).</li>
<li>Based on that conversation, <strong>finalize the MVP</strong>
deliverables: for example, a clearly defined list of required
documentation items and a handful of completed examples in a consistent,
standardized format.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solidify-a-documentation-framework">2. Solidify a Documentation
Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Categorize documentation</strong> into a few main types
(e.g., process vs. technical vs. standards). You’ve already started
this, but try to finalize your list of categories so each team can see
where their work fits.</li>
<li><strong>Draft a simple template</strong> for each type of
documentation. At minimum, include headings like Purpose, Scope, Steps
(for processes), Technical Details, and any relevant references.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-template-layout">Example Template Layout</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Clear name/identifier</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Why this document is needed</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Which teams/systems/processes it covers</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>: Step-by-step instructions for processes,
or architectural overviews for technical docs</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Who is responsible for updates?</li>
<li><strong>Revision History</strong>: Who changed what, and when</li>
</ol>
<p>Even a one-page template helps make documentation consistent and
easier to scan.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-a-few-tools">3. Pilot a Few Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shortlist the tools</strong> your team might realistically
use. For instance, if the organization is heavily into Microsoft
products, SharePoint and Word templates might be simplest. If there is
flexibility, you could consider Confluence, Notion, or GitBook.</li>
<li><strong>Test out each tool</strong> (if possible) by creating a
small sample document in each. Look at ease of use, searchability,
version control, and how it handles multimedia (screenshots, screen
recordings, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Present tool pros/cons</strong> to your manager or the team.
This helps leadership see what might be involved in adoption and
licensing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gather-content-from-each-team">4. Gather Content From Each
Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have each of the four teams (Data Analytics, Data Engineering,
Business Intelligence, and Data Governance) <strong>list their top 3–5
processes or systems</strong> that they consider high priority for
documentation.</li>
<li>Encourage each team to <strong>pick one example</strong> and fill
out the new documentation template. This will serve as your MVP
“showcase.”</li>
<li>Focus on quality over quantity—if people see a solid format, they’ll
be more likely to follow it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implement-naming-conventions-and-version-control">5. Implement
Naming Conventions and Version Control</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Propose naming conventions</strong> for files and folders,
including consistent prefixes, dates, or version tags, to make them easy
to locate.</li>
<li>Decide on a basic version control approach—maybe just a “v1.0, v1.1”
system or something more sophisticated if you use a platform like Git or
a built-in Confluence feature.</li>
<li>Make sure each team knows the naming rules and where the “master
copy” of each document resides.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="provide-guidance-training">6. Provide Guidance &amp;
Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer short walkthroughs</strong> or training sessions for
each team on how to use the chosen tool(s) and follow the documentation
template.</li>
<li>If you want to incorporate <strong>screen recordings and AI-based
transcripts</strong>, demonstrate how it might help them capture
knowledge quickly and then edit for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="review-iterate">7. Review &amp; Iterate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up a feedback loop</strong>—after teams produce their
sample documentation, gather feedback on the template, the process, and
the tools.</li>
<li><strong>Refine the standards</strong> as needed, and make sure you
capture everyone’s suggestions.</li>
<li>As you head into the final weeks, compile all your results and
learnings into a project summary or short final presentation for
leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plan-beyond-the-mvp">8. Plan Beyond the MVP</h2>
<ul>
<li>After the 10-week period, you’ll still have until year-end to
actually “clean up” all documentation. Draft a <strong>post-MVP
roadmap</strong> that outlines next steps, including:
<ul>
<li>Rolling the template out to other teams or departments.</li>
<li>Establishing ongoing maintenance/updates.</li>
<li>Possibly integrating more advanced automation or AI-based solutions
(like automated transcription or generative content drafting) once you
have a stable framework in place.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it simple</strong> at first. A short, workable template
plus a clear, centralized location is often enough to demonstrate
value.</li>
<li><strong>Involve each team</strong> to make sure you capture their
most critical processes or systems.</li>
<li><strong>Document everything you learn</strong> so you can hand off a
sustainable approach to the rest of the department and future
collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these steps, your team will not only meet the short-term
MVP goal but also lay the foundation for a long-term, efficient
documentation culture within your department.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-docs-project-introduction"><strong>The Data Docs
Project: Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The Data Docs Project is a department-wide initiative involving
members from each team in Corporate Data and Analytics—Business
Intelligence, Data Governance, Data Engineering, and Data Analytics. The
project focuses on how we create, store, and access documentation for
the various processes we manage as a department.</p>
<h3 id="main-objectives"><strong>Main Objectives</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Centralization of Documentation</strong><br />
Currently, our knowledge is scattered across multiple platforms: Azure
DevOps boards, Word documents, Excel files on SharePoint, emails, chat
messages, or even in people’s heads. Our first objective is to identify
and consolidate the most critical information into a single, easily
accessible location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standardization of Documentation</strong><br />
While each team’s processes differ, many share common elements. We aim
to develop a consistent, readable structure that highlights these
similarities—without forcing every process into an ill-fitting template.
We should not alter established business practices just to fit a
“one-size-fits-all” format. Instead, we need a flexible but uniform
approach that promotes clarity and usability while accommodating each
process’s unique aspects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of Use</strong><br />
Both writing and finding documentation should be simple and
straightforward. A user-friendly documentation solution increases the
likelihood that team members will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the documentation up to date.</li>
<li>Find relevant information quickly.</li>
<li>Understand the broader context of projects and initiatives.</li>
<li>Drill down into additional details when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our solution should be searchable, easy to digest, and designed to
encourage collaboration and continuous improvement.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-documentation-matters"><strong>Why Documentation
Matters</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Clarity and Alignment</strong><br />
Good documentation ensures that teams share the same understanding of
goals, requirements, and processes. It reduces confusion, repetitive
questions, and reliance on unspoken “tribal” knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency and Scalability</strong><br />
Well-documented procedures streamline onboarding and troubleshooting. We
often pose the scenario, “If a team member suddenly leaves—maybe they
win the lottery—could someone else step in and carry out their
processes?” Proper documentation helps make that possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professionalism and Consistency</strong><br />
A standardized style and structure demonstrate a cohesive brand
identity. Clear formatting also reduces the cognitive burden for people
who read or skim multiple documents.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="foundations-of-good-documentation"><strong>Foundations of Good
Documentation</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Well-Defined Audience and Scope</strong><br />
Tailor content to the readers’ roles and technical backgrounds. Clearly
define what is included and what is out of scope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity and Conciseness</strong><br />
Favor plain language, avoid unnecessary jargon, and define
acronyms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structure and Formatting</strong><br />
Use consistent headings, page layouts, numbering, and version control.
Incorporate visuals (figures, tables, diagrams) to illustrate complex
ideas. Maintain a style guide that details fonts, spacing, labeling
conventions, and corporate branding guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance and Revision</strong><br />
Documentation must evolve with each product or process. Assign owners,
automate reminders, and schedule regular reviews to keep content
fresh.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="types-of-documentation"><strong>Types of
Documentation</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve recognized that not all documentation is the same. Some common
categories include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Business Process Documentation</strong><br />
Outlines all the actions a person must perform to complete a task or
carry out a process. For example, a step-by-step guide that walks a user
through a recurring workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Documentation</strong><br />
Explains how automated systems or software operate, enabling others to
debug or modify them as needed. This is especially important for data
pipelines, machine learning processes, and other automated
tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Management Documentation</strong><br />
Includes meeting agendas and minutes, scope statements, and decision
logs—essential for tracking project progress and decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standards or Naming Conventions</strong><br />
Details how to name databases, views, tables, and other objects
consistently. This might include guidelines like camelCase, snake_case,
or prefix conventions for different types of data assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Level Goals or Mission Statements</strong><br />
Broad statements that ensure everyone understands the overall objectives
and direction of the department or project.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="deciding-what-to-document"><strong>Deciding What to
Document</strong></h2>
<p>In one discussion, we focused on identifying <strong>which processes
and items actually need documentation</strong>. We agreed on the
importance of documenting any <strong>regular, repeatable
processes</strong>. We also debated whether to document every one-off
project. The consensus was that we don’t need to document trivial or
purely unique events. However, if a one-off project involves a unique or
complex issue, <strong>what was learned should be documented</strong> to
prevent “reinventing the wheel” later.</p>
<p>We also acknowledged some confusion around terms like “processes,”
“procedures,” or “workflows,” but agreed they all refer to how we
consistently get things done. For clarity, we may just pick one term
(e.g., “process”) and use it consistently.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="tools-and-platforms"><strong>Tools and Platforms</strong></h2>
<p>A large part of our conversation covered potential tools and
platforms for creating and organizing documentation. Examples
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obsidian</strong></li>
<li><strong>Confluence</strong></li>
<li><strong>Notion</strong></li>
<li><strong>SharePoint</strong> (potentially with Word documents stored
in a central library)</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed the possibility of using <strong>screen
recordings</strong> and then transcribing them into text for searching
and summarizing. This would make it easy to add quick how-to videos
alongside written explanations.</p>
<p>However, we also recognized that <strong>the real challenge is
writing good documentation</strong>, not just picking a tool. Tools can
help, but the effort to document procedures accurately still requires
human input and maintenance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="format-and-consistency"><strong>Format and
Consistency</strong></h2>
<p>We want a balance between <strong>consistency</strong> and
<strong>flexibility</strong>. Different document types—process docs,
project logs, technical references—may not look identical, but they
should share certain <strong>standard elements</strong> where relevant,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction or Summary</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Stakeholders</li>
<li>Inputs and Outputs</li>
<li>Permissions or Security Requirements</li>
<li>Version/Revision History</li>
</ul>
<p>When these elements do appear, they should be presented in a
recognizable way across teams.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="naming-conventions-and-storage"><strong>Naming Conventions and
Storage</strong></h2>
<p>We need to decide <strong>where</strong> documents are stored and
<strong>how</strong> they are named to avoid confusion. This involves
setting up:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear folder or space structure (e.g., SharePoint site, Confluence
space).</li>
<li>A consistent naming scheme for files (potentially including version
numbers and dates).</li>
</ul>
<p>We also talked about examples where a data architect provided strict
naming conventions for databases and views, such as guidelines for base
views, selection views, derived views, interface views, and
associations. That kind of documentation is essential for consistency in
data engineering work.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="resistance-and-job-security-concerns"><strong>Resistance and Job
Security Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>We acknowledged that some individuals might worry that sharing
detailed documentation threatens their job security. It’s important to
emphasize that thorough documentation is about <strong>knowledge
sharing</strong> and <strong>team continuity</strong>, not replacing
roles.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="enhancing-documentation-with-video"><strong>Enhancing
Documentation with Video</strong></h2>
<p>Videos can be helpful for tasks that are easier to demonstrate
visually. Screen recordings, especially when paired with transcripts,
allow for more engaging and accessible guides. The text from these
transcripts can be <strong>searched</strong> or
<strong>summarized</strong> by various tools, making the overall process
more efficient.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="version-control-and-updates"><strong>Version Control and
Updates</strong></h2>
<p>Documentation becomes outdated quickly if it’s not actively
maintained. We need a clear version control process, which might be as
simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a version table in Word documents (last updated date, who
updated, summary of changes).</li>
<li>Using a platform that supports version control (like Git or built-in
Confluence features).</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular reviews or scheduled reminders ensure content stays
relevant.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="examples-from-data-engineering"><strong>Examples from Data
Engineering</strong></h2>
<p>In Data Engineering, a typical example might be documenting a
<strong>data flow</strong> from source systems into the enterprise data
warehouse. This would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the source tables live.</li>
<li>What transformations are performed.</li>
<li>How the data flows through staging, integration, and presentation
layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such technical details are crucial for troubleshooting and onboarding
new team members.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, the Data Docs Project aims to establish
a cohesive, department-wide approach to documentation that is
centralized, standardized, and user-friendly. By defining different
types of documentation, clarifying which processes to document,
exploring tools, and creating consistent formats and naming conventions,
we hope to improve knowledge sharing, efficiency, and alignment across
all teams in Corporate Data and Analytics.</p>

<h1 id="data-docs-project-overview-and-next-steps"><strong>Data Docs
Project: Overview and Next Steps</strong></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-and-context"><strong>1. Introduction and
Context</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department &amp; Company</strong><br />
We work in Corporate Data and Analytics at a life insurance company with
a long history and multiple traditional departments (e.g., Actuarial,
Underwriting, Claims, etc.). Our data-focused department is relatively
new, and we’ve been tasked with improving documentation across all our
teams.</li>
<li><strong>Goal &amp; Timeline</strong><br />
Our department aims to clean up and centralize documentation by the end
of the year. We have a 10-week project (currently 3 weeks in) to propose
and pilot solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Vague Initial Challenge</strong><br />
Managers asked: “What should our department’s documentation look like by
year-end?” They highlighted:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Centralization</strong> – A single place for all key
documents.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization</strong> – Consistent
formatting/structure.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong> – Straightforward for both writers and
readers.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-weve-accomplished-so-far"><strong>2. What We’ve
Accomplished So Far</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Clarified Why Documentation Matters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity &amp; Alignment</strong>: Ensures everyone shares
the same goals and processes.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency &amp; Scalability</strong>: Makes
onboarding/troubleshooting faster; helps if someone leaves or
transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Professionalism &amp; Consistency</strong>: A standardized
approach reduces confusion and presents a unified brand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Explored Different Documentation Types</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process Documentation</strong>: Step-by-step guides for
recurring human-performed tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong>: Explains how automated
systems (e.g., data pipelines) function, facilitating debugging and
updates.</li>
<li><strong>Project Management Artifacts</strong>: Meeting notes,
decision logs, scope statements.</li>
<li><strong>Standards &amp; Naming Conventions</strong>: Database naming
rules, file naming consistency, etc.</li>
<li><strong>High-Level Goals or Mission Statements</strong>: Gives teams
a unifying direction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Key Needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Central Repository</strong> (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence,
Notion, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Consistent But Flexible Templates</strong>: Common headings
(Purpose, Scope, Steps, Ownership, Revision History), adapted to
specific document types.</li>
<li><strong>Naming Conventions &amp; Version Control</strong>: Ensure
documents remain organized and updated.</li>
<li><strong>Tools &amp; Methods</strong>: Possibility of screen
recordings with transcripts, AI-assisted summaries, or just standard
Word documents—depending on each team’s comfort and needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outlined a Proposed MVP (Minimum Viable
Product)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A List of What Needs Documenting</strong> across our four
teams: Data Analytics, Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Data
Governance.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Documentation</strong> for each team, showcasing a
consistent format (like 4–5 pages total, one per team).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="observations-and-challenges"><strong>3. Observations and
Challenges</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differences Among Teams</strong>: Data Engineering might
focus on pipeline details, while Business Intelligence might emphasize
dashboards or reporting processes. Not all documentation can look
identical, but it should feel cohesive.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance &amp; Job Security</strong>: Some team members
may worry that documenting “their” processes makes them replaceable.
Emphasize that documentation is a shared resource, not a threat.</li>
<li><strong>Tools vs. Content</strong>: Tools alone don’t solve the
problem; the real effort is generating high-quality, accurate
documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps-proposed-action-plan"><strong>4. Next Steps (Proposed
Action Plan)</strong></h2>
<p>Below is a concise roadmap to guide our team over the remaining
weeks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Refine the Project Scope</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meet with managers (Thursday) to confirm what success looks like:
<ul>
<li>Do they expect full tool recommendations or just a working
prototype?</li>
<li>What exact level of standardization do they want?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finalize which deliverables we can realistically provide in the next
7 weeks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a Documentation Framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize <strong>categories</strong> (Process Docs, Technical Docs,
Standards, etc.).</li>
<li>Draft simple <strong>templates</strong> for each category with
common headings (Title, Purpose, Scope, Details, Ownership, Revision
History).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tool Evaluation &amp; Pilot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pick the top 2–3 potential tools (e.g., SharePoint/Word, Confluence,
Notion).</li>
<li>Create a <strong>sample document</strong> in each tool to test ease
of use, version control, and searchability.</li>
<li>Gather initial feedback from your team on Monday, and present a
short pros/cons list to managers on Thursday.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Gather Content From Each Team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask each of the four teams to identify their <strong>top 3–5
processes</strong> or systems needing documentation.</li>
<li>Have them <strong>pick one</strong> to document using the newly
created template. This forms the “MVP Showcase.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Naming Conventions &amp; Version Control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a naming scheme (e.g., “ProcessName_v1.0.docx” or
“BI_Pipeline_2025-02_v1.md”).</li>
<li>Propose a simple version control approach—could be an in-document
table for changes or a platform with built-in version history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Training &amp; Guidance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <strong>brief walkthroughs</strong> for each team on how to
use the chosen tool(s) and follow the template.</li>
<li>Demonstrate optional enhancements (screen recordings, AI summaries)
if resources allow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review &amp; Iterate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the teams produce their sample docs, collect feedback.</li>
<li>Refine templates, naming conventions, or tool choices based on
real-world usage.</li>
<li>Keep a <strong>shared feedback log</strong> so we can track
improvements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Post-MVP Roadmap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the 10-week pilot ends, plan how to <strong>scale</strong> the
framework department-wide.</li>
<li>Schedule <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>: monthly or quarterly
reviews, ownership assignments, etc.</li>
<li>Consider more advanced automation or AI-based solutions once the
basics are in place.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-we-will-present-on-thursday"><strong>5. What We Will
Present on Thursday</strong></h2>
<p>By Thursday’s manager check-in, we aim to have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>A Clearly Defined Scope</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly we’re delivering in the MVP (e.g., a small, tested
documentation framework + some example docs).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>A Draft Template &amp; Tool Shortlist</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate one or two short, completed documents to illustrate the
template.</li>
<li>Show a brief comparison of tool options (pros, cons, licensing
needs).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>A Team-Agreed Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation that each of the four teams understands what they’re
documenting and that we’ve addressed any concerns about security or
“busy work.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary-and-conclusion"><strong>6. Summary and
Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Data Docs Project</strong> is about establishing a
cohesive, department-wide approach to documentation that is
<strong>centralized</strong>, <strong>standardized</strong>, and
<strong>user-friendly</strong>. We’ve clarified why this is important,
laid out the various documentation types, and identified some tools and
best practices. The next step is to <strong>finalize a practical
MVP</strong> and get manager buy-in on our approach.</p>
<p>By focusing on a clear template, a modest pilot of tools, and
gathering concrete examples from each team, we’ll demonstrate real
progress in the coming weeks—while still leaving room for further
development throughout the year.</p>

could use for creating, organizing, and sharing data documentation. Each
one has different strengths and trade-offs, so your choice may depend on
your department’s collaboration style, technical requirements, and
existing company infrastructure. Here’s a quick overview of how each
tool might fit into your <strong>Data Docs Project</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="notion"><strong>1. Notion</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-in-One Workspace</strong><br />
Notion provides an intuitive blend of document creation, wikis,
databases, and project management features. This flexibility can help
you unify process docs, technical references, meeting notes, and
more—all in one platform.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Collaboration</strong><br />
Teams can edit pages in real time, leave comments, and track changes.
Notion’s built-in templates and AI features (for writing, summarizing,
and searching) can speed up documentation tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Yet Simple</strong><br />
While Notion is highly customizable, it remains relatively
user-friendly, which can reduce onboarding friction. The downside is
that with so many features, some teams might need guidance to avoid
confusion or “over-engineering” their workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Fit for the Data Docs Project</strong><br />
If you need a collaborative, visually appealing way to store a variety
of documentation types (processes, technical specs, etc.) and quickly
adapt as the project evolves, Notion is a strong contender.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="confluence"><strong>2. Confluence</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enterprise Wiki Structure</strong><br />
Confluence is well-known for organizing corporate knowledge. Its
“Spaces” and “Pages” model fosters a clear hierarchy, making it easy to
structure department-wide documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Atlassian Ecosystem</strong><br />
It integrates seamlessly with Jira and other Atlassian products—great if
your teams already use Jira for project tracking. Confluence supports
collaborative editing, comments, and version history for your
pages.</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Scalability</strong><br />
Confluence has robust permission settings and can handle large user
bases, which is beneficial if your life insurance company’s
documentation initiative spans multiple departments.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Fit for the Data Docs Project</strong><br />
If your organization values a more traditional wiki approach, is already
invested in the Atlassian ecosystem, or needs enterprise-level
governance, Confluence is a safe and scalable choice.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="obsidian"><strong>3. Obsidian</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local-First, Markdown-Based</strong><br />
Obsidian stores all notes locally as plain Markdown files. This can be
advantageous if your team needs to retain control over data, avoid
proprietary lock-in, or work offline.</li>
<li><strong>Backlinks and Graph View</strong><br />
It excels at creating “knowledge maps” through internal linking and a
graph view, which can be great for visually exploring how different
processes or technical components connect.</li>
<li><strong>Highly Customizable &amp; Lightweight</strong><br />
Obsidian’s plugin ecosystem and theming options offer plenty of
flexibility. However, it is more of a note-taking/personal knowledge
management tool than a traditional collaborative wiki, so team
collaboration might require additional setup (e.g., using a shared drive
or Obsidian Sync).</li>
<li><strong>Potential Fit for the Data Docs Project</strong><br />
If you’re dealing with a smaller, tech-savvy team that values offline
access, deep linking between concepts, and custom workflows—or if your
documentation approach is more developer-oriented—Obsidian might be
ideal. For broad, department-wide adoption, you’d need to ensure you
have a solid syncing/collaboration strategy in place.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-tool-is-best-for-data-documentation"><strong>Which Tool Is
Best for Data Documentation?</strong></h3>
<p>It ultimately depends on your department’s <strong>collaboration
style</strong>, <strong>technical requirements</strong>, <strong>IT
constraints</strong>, and <strong>future maintenance plans</strong>. If
you want an <strong>enterprise-grade wiki</strong> closely tied to
project management, Confluence might fit. If you need a <strong>highly
flexible, visually appealing</strong> workspace that can handle
everything from process docs to databases in a single place, Notion is
appealing. If your priority is <strong>local data ownership</strong>,
advanced linking, and a developer-friendly environment, Obsidian stands
out.</p>
<p>In many organizations, <strong>SharePoint</strong> (already part of
Microsoft 365) or a <strong>combination</strong> of these tools might
also make sense—especially if the company wants to minimize new
licenses. The key is to <strong>test a small sample of
documents</strong> in each tool, gather feedback from team members, and
see how well each platform meets your documentation goals of being
<strong>centralized</strong>, <strong>standardized</strong>, and
<strong>easy to use</strong>.</p>
