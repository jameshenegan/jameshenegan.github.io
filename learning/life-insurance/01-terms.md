Your understanding of how a life insurance company operates is largely correct, but I can add some details to clarify the roles and processes involved:

1. **Actuary**: Actuaries play a critical role in designing life insurance products. They assess risks, set premium rates, and ensure that the products are financially viable for the company. Using statistical models, they evaluate factors such as mortality rates, investment returns, and expenses to determine the pricing of the insurance product and its various features.

2. **Agent (or Broker)**: Agents or brokers are responsible for selling the life insurance product. They work directly with potential customers, explaining the features, benefits, and costs of the insurance product, and helping them select the right policy based on their needs. The agent helps the customer through the application process and submits the necessary documentation to the insurance company.

3. **Application Submission**: If a potential customer decides to move forward, they submit an application. The application typically includes personal information, financial details, and health history. Depending on the type of policy, it may also involve medical exams or lab tests.

4. **Underwriter**: Once the application is received, an underwriter reviews it to assess the risk the applicant poses to the insurance company. Underwriting involves evaluating the applicant's age, health status, occupation, lifestyle, and other factors that may impact their life expectancy. Based on the risk profile, the underwriter decides whether to approve or reject the application, and if approved, at what premium rate. Sometimes, additional medical tests or information are requested to make an informed decision.

5. **Policy Issuance**: If the underwriter approves the application, the insurance company will issue a life insurance policy. The policy is a legal contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the coverage, including the premium payments, the death benefit, and any additional riders or features.

6. **Policyholder**: Once the policy is issued, the customer becomes a policyholder and is required to make regular premium payments. In return, the insurance company guarantees the payment of the death benefit to the policyholder's beneficiaries in the event of their death, provided the policy remains in force (i.e., premiums are paid on time and other conditions are met).

The overall process you've described is accurate, but these additional layers help to explain the different responsibilities and the flow of operations more fully.
