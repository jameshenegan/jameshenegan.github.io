  <body><h1 id="hazy">Hazy</h1>
<p>I am curious about working “on-prem” versus “in the cloud”. Can Hazy
work “on prem”? Can it work “in the cloud”?</p>
<p>Yes, Hazy can work both “on-prem” and “in the cloud”:</p>
<p><strong>On-Premises Deployment:</strong> Hazy offers on-premises
deployment options for customers who prefer to keep their sensitive data
within their own infrastructure[1]. This approach ensures that no data
leaves the customer’s secure environment.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Deployment:</strong> Hazy also supports cloud
deployments, offering flexibility for organizations that have migrated
to cloud infrastructure[1]. Specifically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hazy is available on AWS Marketplace, allowing customers to deploy
it effortlessly in their private cloud[2].</li>
<li>It can be deployed on various cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure,
and Google Cloud[1].</li>
</ol>
<p>Hazy’s distributed architecture, which runs on Kubernetes, enables
both on-premises and cloud deployments, providing scalability and
flexibility for enterprises with complex infrastructure needs[1][3].</p>
<p>This flexibility in deployment options allows organizations to choose
the most suitable approach based on their security requirements,
existing infrastructure, and data governance policies.</p>

option provides maximum control over your data and environment.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-deployment">Cloud Deployment</h2>
<p>Syntho also supports deployment in various cloud environments,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private clouds (e.g., your organization’s own cloud
infrastructure)</li>
<li>Public clouds (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud)</li>
<li>Syntho’s own cloud (as an optional offering)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flexible-deployment-options">Flexible Deployment Options</h2>
<p>The Syntho Engine, which is the core of their synthetic data
generation platform, offers the following deployment possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-premise</li>
<li>Any private cloud</li>
<li>Any public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)</li>
<li>Syntho cloud</li>
<li>Any other environment that supports Docker or Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deployment-benefits">Deployment Benefits</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: Syntho typically deploys within
the customer’s secure environment, ensuring sensitive data never leaves
the trusted environment[1][5].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seamless Integration</strong>: The platform can be easily
plugged into your chosen environment and connected to your existing
databases, applications, and file systems[5].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Containerization</strong>: Syntho uses Docker containers,
making it highly portable and easy to deploy across different

within the organization’s own environment, addressing strict data
privacy and security requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: On-premises deployment allows for
greater customization to fit specific infrastructure needs.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong>: It helps meet regulatory requirements
that mandate keeping data within certain geographical boundaries or
under direct organizational control.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-deployment-1">Cloud Deployment</h2>
<p>Statice also offers cloud deployment options, which provide
flexibility and scalability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managed Service</strong>: Statice can be deployed as a
managed service in the cloud, reducing the operational burden on the
organization.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Cloud deployment allows for easy
scaling of resources as needed.</li>

<h1 id="genrocket">GenRocket</h1>
<p>I am curious about working “on-prem” versus “in the cloud”. Can
GenRocket work “on prem”? Can it work “in the cloud”?</p>
<p>GenRocket offers a hybrid approach that combines both on-premises and
cloud-based components, allowing for flexibility in deployment while
maintaining security and scalability.</p>
<h2 id="on-premises-capabilities">On-Premises Capabilities</h2>
<p>GenRocket can indeed work on-premises in several ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>GenRocket Runtime</strong>: This core component is
designed to be installed and run on-premises, behind the customer’s
corporate firewall[1][3]. It can be deployed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual developer or tester machines</li>
<li>Centralized test automation servers</li>
<li>Containers (e.g., Docker)[1]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>G-Repository</strong>: This is a centralized and secure
repository that manages configuration files, user access, and system
usage. It exists on-premises within the corporate
environment[3].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GenRocket Multi-User Server (GMUS)</strong>: This shared
environment can be deployed on-premises to manage test data requests and
delivery[1].</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cloud-capabilities">Cloud Capabilities</h2>
<p>GenRocket also leverages cloud technology:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>GenRocket Cloud</strong>: This component is hosted on AWS
and is used for test data design[3]. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A secure multitenant environment</li>
<li>Self-service components for licensed users</li>
<li>High availability and scalability</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</strong>: Most customers
(90%) are hosted in a secure VPC environment on AWS[3].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dedicated Private Cloud (DPC)</strong>: An optional
offering for customers who require a dedicated cloud
environment[3].</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hybrid-approach">Hybrid Approach</h2>
<p>GenRocket’s architecture is designed as a secure hybrid cloud
environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test data design takes place in the cloud</li>
<li>Test data generation occurs on-premises, behind the customer’s
firewall[3]</li>
</ul>
<p>This separation enhances security while allowing for scalability and
ease of use. The G-Repository acts as a secure proxy, facilitating
communication between on-premises components and GenRocket Cloud
Services[3][4].</p>
<p>In conclusion, GenRocket offers a flexible solution that can work
both on-premises and in the cloud, with a hybrid approach that leverages
the strengths of both deployment models.</p>

<h1 id="ydata">YData</h1>
<p>I am curious about working “on-prem” versus “in the cloud”. Can YData
work “on prem”? Can it work “in the cloud”?</p>
<p>Yes, YData Fabric can work both “on-premises” and “in the cloud”,
offering flexibility to meet different deployment preferences and
requirements:</p>
<h2 id="on-premises-deployment-4">On-Premises Deployment</h2>
<p>YData Fabric supports on-premises deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is described as a kubernetes-native solution that can be deployed
in any infrastructure[1].</li>
<li>This allows organizations to keep their data and processing within
their own data centers, which can be crucial for companies with strict
data security and compliance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-deployment-4">Cloud Deployment</h2>
<p>YData Fabric also offers cloud deployment options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform can be deployed on major cloud providers like Microsoft
Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS)[2][4].</li>
<li>It provides one-click deployment options for both Azure and AWS,
making it easy to set up in cloud environments[4][6].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-features-of-cloud-deployment">Key Features of Cloud
Deployment</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scalability: Cloud deployment allows for rapid scaling of resources
to meet varying workloads[2].</li>
<li>Global Infrastructure: Cloud providers’ global infrastructure
enables deployment in multiple regions for low latency and high
availability[2].</li>
<li>Security: Cloud deployments leverage comprehensive security features
of providers like Azure, including data encryption, network firewalls,
and identity management[2].</li>
<li>Integration: YData Fabric can connect to various cloud-based
databases, warehouses, and data lakes[4][6].</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>
<p>The ability to deploy both on-premises and in the cloud gives
organizations the flexibility to choose the deployment model that best
fits their needs, whether it’s for data security, compliance,
scalability, or integration with existing infrastructure.</p>
