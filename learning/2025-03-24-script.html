  <body><p>input/Home 363.m4a So, David has set us up with some tools to use.
Let’s see how to use them. One, pick a question from our list of
questions related to life insurance. Two, choose a version of the site,
either the original or the alternate version. Three, send the question
you selected to the custom generative engine that’s configured to access
the version of the site you selected. Four, compute the visibility
score. Five, repeat and average. So, there’s some randomness in this
process that’s coming from the LLM inside of the generative engine. We
are to address this, we’re going to perform multiple trials for each
combination of questions and site version. The main purpose behind our
experiment is to see whether the new AI friendly version of the site
outperforms the original version. The short answer is yes. For nearly
every question we considered, the new version had both a higher
visibility score and a better ranking than the original version. For
example, when we asked what products are offered by our company, the
original version of the site scored 0.24 and had a ranking of four. This
means that there were three other sites that did a better job of
answering this question, at least through the eyes of the generative
engine. On the other hand, the alternate version of the site had a
visibility score of 0.27 and a ranking of one. If you look at the
handout, you will see similar results for the other questions we
considered. However, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize
that our project as a whole isn’t really about these specific numbers.
Instead, what we are offering is a repeatable process for measuring and
enhancing our presence in AI-generated summaries for questions that you
think our site should be able to answer. With that, I will hand it over
to David so that he can wrap things up.</p>
