  <body><h1 id="protective-value">Protective Value</h1>
<p><strong>Detailed Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper introduces the concept of a <em>protective value
study</em> for underwriting procedures in insurance. The essential
question is whether a particular underwriting process saves more
(through identifying and appropriately charging for higher mortality or
morbidity risks) than it costs to implement. The author lays out a
straightforward but thorough framework for conducting such an analysis,
focusing on the following key elements:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fundamental-question">1. Fundamental Question</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: An underwriting procedure has
positive economic value if the present value of savings in
mortality/morbidity (M/M) exceeds the total cost of performing the
procedure.</li>
<li>The savings arise because, without the procedure, an insurer would
charge <em>standard</em> premiums to applicants who actually present
<em>substandard</em> risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="measuring-mortalitymorbidity-savings">2. Measuring
Mortality/Morbidity Savings</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Excess M/M</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically expressed as a percentage above the standard M/M
assumption.</li>
<li>For example, if a substandard risk is projected to have 150% of the
standard mortality rate, the excess 50% is what contributes to the
protective value when identified.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Special Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declined Applications</strong>: Can be modeled as having a
very high “virtual” substandard rating (e.g., standard + 50%
extra).</li>
<li><strong>Not Takens</strong>: If a substandard offer is made but not
accepted, it can be viewed differently than a policy that is
accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusions or Modified Coverage</strong>: If coverage
modifications do not include a substandard premium rating, one might
still treat them like a high substandard rating for analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clinical/Alternate Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If standard reinsurance manuals or standard tables do not exist for
certain impairments, the underwriter can rely on clinical or medical
studies.</li>
<li>These data must be adapted (or “mapped”) to known standard tables
(e.g., SOA 1975–80 Basic Mortality) to estimate the relative excess
M/M.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="persistency">3. Persistency</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact on Savings</strong>: Higher persistency (lower lapse
rate) means more individuals remain in force over time, which increases
the insurer’s exposure but also increases the aggregate excess M/M
collected from substandard risks.</li>
<li><strong>Substandard Cohorts Often Have Higher Persistency</strong>:
Applicants with fewer market options for coverage (due to substandard
health) may be <em>less</em> likely to lapse. This elevates their
overall contribution to excess M/M.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="interest-rate-and-time-period">4. Interest Rate and Time
Period</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Discounting Future Savings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because excess M/M savings occur over future years, they must be
discounted to a present value.</li>
<li>A higher discount rate reduces the present value of those future M/M
savings; a lower rate increases it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Horizon</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of years included in the analysis will affect total
calculated savings.</li>
<li>Over many years, especially if a policy can remain in force for a
long duration, the cumulative M/M differences can be significant.</li>
<li>Choosing a shorter-than-maximum horizon <em>understates</em> the
potential savings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="prevalence">5. Prevalence</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: The proportion of applicants who
actually have the excess mortality/morbidity condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Influence on Protective Value</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Low Prevalence</em>: It may be inefficient to test everyone if
very few applicants exhibit the impairment. Thus, insurers often raise
the coverage thresholds or target specific ages and amounts for more
thorough underwriting.</li>
<li><em>Geographical Variation</em>: Different regions can have
different prevalence rates (e.g., HIV infection rates). This can drive
selective use of certain tests in certain territories (subject to legal
constraints).</li>
<li><em>Age Variation</em>: Some conditions, such as coronary artery
disease, occur more frequently at older ages, guiding insurers to
introduce underwriting requirements by age bands.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Partial Testing and “Untested” Risk</strong>: If an
insurer chooses not to test all applicants (e.g., below a certain
coverage amount), some proportion of substandard risks will remain
unidentified. The associated “missed” excess M/M is a cost that must be
accounted for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Formula</strong>:<br />
[ ;=; ( ;-; ) ]<br />
This captures how many substandard cases are identified (prevalence) and
the difference between present value of losses in tested vs. untested
groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="costs-of-the-procedure">6. Costs of the Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-In Costs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Direct cost of the test or report (e.g., physician’s statement, lab
test).</li>
<li>Ancillary processing expenses (e.g., mailing, administrative
overhead).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These generally do not vary by age or policy size but are incurred
for each applicant tested.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="decision-criteria">7. Decision Criteria</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Break-Even Method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the coverage amount (or threshold) at which the present value
of M/M savings equals the underwriting procedure’s cost.</li>
<li>The interest rate is chosen to reflect the insurer’s opportunity
cost or internal rate for reserves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Return on Investment (ROI) Method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve for the discount rate at which the present value of savings
equals the cost for a given amount of insurance.</li>
<li>If the resulting ROI is higher than the insurer’s internal target
rate, the procedure is deemed to have protective value at that coverage
level.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>These two methods produce consistent conclusions if the same
discount rate is used as the insurer’s time-value of money. However, the
break-even method emphasizes an “amount of insurance” threshold, whereas
ROI focuses on the implied rate of return.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The paper provides a <em>simple and general</em> approach to
determine the protective value of underwriting procedures. By breaking
down:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to measure excess mortality/morbidity,</li>
<li>The significance of persistency and prevalence,</li>
<li>The time-value of money (interest rate and time horizon),</li>
<li>And the costs involved,</li>
</ul>
<p>the author shows how insurers can systematically quantify whether the
savings from identifying substandard risks <em>outweigh</em> the
expenses of underwriting. This framework is then applied (in
hypothetical examples) to illustrate how to decide if an underwriting
method is economically justified, either by finding the break-even
coverage threshold or by comparing the ROI to the insurer’s required
rate of return.</p>
