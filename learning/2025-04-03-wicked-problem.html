  <body><p>A “wicked problem” refers to a complex issue that is difficult or
impossible to solve due to its multifaceted, interconnected nature and
the lack of a clear, definitive solution. The term was introduced in
1973 by design theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in the context
of social policy and planning, where traditional problem-solving methods
often fall short[1][2].</p>
<h3 id="key-characteristics-of-wicked-problems">Key Characteristics of
Wicked Problems</h3>
<p>Rittel and Webber outlined several defining features of wicked
problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>No Definitive Formulation</strong>: The problem cannot be
clearly or fully defined.</li>
<li><strong>No Stopping Rule</strong>: There is no clear point at which
the problem can be considered solved.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions Are Not Right or Wrong</strong>: Instead, they are
judged as better or worse based on context.</li>
<li><strong>Irreversible Solutions</strong>: Each attempt to solve the
problem has significant consequences, making trial-and-error approaches
impractical.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Nature</strong>: Every wicked problem is essentially
one-of-a-kind.</li>
<li><strong>Interconnectedness</strong>: Solving one aspect of the
problem often creates or reveals new issues.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Disagreement</strong>: Different stakeholders
may have conflicting views on the nature of the problem and its
solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Constraints</strong>: The resources, constraints,
and conditions affecting the problem evolve over time[1][2][3].</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples-of-wicked-problems">Examples of Wicked Problems</h3>
<p>Wicked problems are commonly found in areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Involves global cooperation,
regional impacts, and evolving science.</li>
<li><strong>Poverty</strong>: Intersects with education, healthcare, and
economic systems.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Reform</strong>: Balances cost, accessibility,
and quality across diverse populations.</li>
<li><strong>Homelessness</strong>: Combines social, economic, and policy
challenges[1][3][5].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-are-they-wicked">Why Are They “Wicked”?</h3>
<p>The term “wicked” does not imply evil but rather resistance to
resolution. These problems often involve deep social complexity, where
every proposed solution affects numerous interconnected factors. Unlike
“tame” problems (e.g., mathematical puzzles), wicked problems defy
standard methods of resolution and require innovative, collaborative
approaches[1][6].</p>
<p>In summary, wicked problems are characterized by their complexity,
lack of definitive solutions, and evolving nature. Addressing them
requires adaptive thinking, stakeholder collaboration, and a focus on
mitigating rather than fully resolving issues.</p>
