id="overview-of-azure-devops-projects-and-processes"><strong>Overview of
Azure DevOps Projects and Processes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps Projects</strong>:<br />
A project in Azure DevOps is a container for all the data and tools
needed to plan, develop, test, and deliver software. It includes boards
for task tracking, repositories for source control, pipelines for CI/CD,
test plans, and more. Projects can be organized as a single project
(with shared resources and visibility) or as multiple projects (for
greater security and autonomy).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Processes</strong>:<br />
When creating a project, you choose a process (Basic, Agile, Scrum, or
CMMI) that defines the types of work items you’ll use.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Basic process</strong>, you can create
<strong>epics</strong>, <strong>issues</strong>, and
<strong>tasks</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Agile process</strong>, you work with
<strong>epics</strong>, <strong>features</strong>, <strong>user
stories</strong>, and <strong>tasks</strong>.</li>
<li>In <strong>Scrum</strong> and <strong>CMMI</strong>, work item types
differ to match those methodologies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3
id="hierarchy-and-sizing-in-agile-epic-feature-user-story-task"><strong>Hierarchy
and Sizing in Agile (Epic &gt; Feature &gt; User Story &gt;
Task)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Epic</strong>:<br />
An epic represents a large initiative or a high-level objective that
spans multiple sprints. For instance, an “MLOps project” (with goals
like implementing Git version control, managing code in an Azure DevOps
Repository, and separating development from production environments) is
best viewed as an epic because it encompasses several significant
changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature</strong>:<br />
Within an epic, features break down the larger initiative into more
manageable segments or capabilities. Each feature corresponds to a
specific goal that contributes to the overall epic. In the MLOps
example, the different goals (using Git, structuring repositories, and
splitting workspaces) can be viewed as individual features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Story</strong>:<br />
A user story describes a specific requirement or functionality from the
perspective of an end user. It is more granular than a feature and is
meant to be completed within a sprint. There’s a common guideline that a
user story should represent roughly a week of work, although this is
flexible and depends on team velocity and project context. This
contrasts with your observation that some projects seem too large for a
single user story.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task (Work Item)</strong>:<br />
Tasks are the smallest actionable items. They break down user stories
into specific work actions. Teams often use the guideline that tasks
should take between 8 to 12 hours of work. In Azure DevOps, tasks (like
other work items) are used to track progress and ensure that each piece
of work is clearly defined and assigned.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="additional-azure-boards-concepts"><strong>Additional Azure
Boards Concepts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work Items</strong>:<br />
These are the building blocks used to track all kinds of work—from
high-level initiatives (epics) to detailed tasks. In Azure Boards, work
items move through states such as <strong>To Do</strong>,
<strong>Doing</strong>, and <strong>Done</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backlogs and Boards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backlogs</strong>: Serve as the roadmap for what your team
plans to deliver. They let you prioritize and manage epics, features,
user stories, and tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Boards</strong>: Provide a visual management tool where you
can see the current status of all work items and move them between
columns corresponding to their state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sprints and Delivery Plans</strong>:<br />
Sprints (or iterations) divide the work into time-boxed periods
(typically two to three weeks). Delivery plans offer a high-level
overview that aligns the work across multiple teams and
sprints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Queries</strong>:<br />
You can use queries to filter and find work items based on criteria like
type, state, or tags, making it easier to manage and review the
progress.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3
id="practical-application-and-estimation-guidelines"><strong>Practical
Application and Estimation Guidelines</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organizing Large Initiatives</strong>:<br />
Your MLOps project, which is larger than what should fit in a single
user story, is a perfect candidate to be structured as an
<strong>epic</strong>. The goals within it can be considered
<strong>features</strong>, and then you can write specific <strong>user
stories</strong> (with an estimated effort of about a week each) and
further break these down into <strong>tasks</strong> (each estimated to
take roughly 8–12 hours).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimation Guidelines</strong>:<br />
While the 8–12 hours per task and about one week per user story are
common guidelines in Agile practices, these are not hard rules. They
serve as starting points that should be adjusted based on your team’s
historical data and velocity. For more on Agile estimation techniques,
you might review resources such as the <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/">Agile Alliance website</a> or <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/">Microsoft’s
Azure DevOps documentation</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>By aligning your project work items with the hierarchy of epic &gt;
feature &gt; user story &gt; task, you can better manage and track both
large initiatives and the smaller, actionable items needed to complete
them. This structure not only clarifies the scope of each part of the
project but also helps in planning, assigning, and estimating work in a
way that supports Agile best practices within Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>For further details, refer to the <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/">Azure
Boards documentation</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This summary should help you explain to your manager how to break
down larger projects into appropriately sized work items within Azure
DevOps and align with Agile practices.</p>
