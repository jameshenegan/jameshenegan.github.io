# Terminology

## Policies, Annualized Premium, Face Value

In the context of a life insurance business, the terms "policies," "annualized premium," and "face value" are key concepts that relate to how life insurance contracts are structured and valued. Here’s what each term typically means:

### 1. **Policies**

- **Definition**: A "policy" refers to a life insurance contract between the insurer (the life insurance company) and the policyholder (the person who buys the insurance).
- **Context in life insurance**: Each policy represents an agreement that the insurer will pay a specified amount (usually a lump sum) to the beneficiaries of the policyholder in the event of the insured person's death, in exchange for regular premium payments from the policyholder. The insurer's book may have thousands of policies, each representing an individual or group covered by the insurance.

### 2. **Annualized Premium**

- **Definition**: The "annualized premium" is the total amount of premium payments the policyholder is expected to pay over the course of a year, regardless of whether they pay monthly, quarterly, or annually.
- **Context in life insurance**: It is a standard way for insurers to calculate and report the value of policies, making it easier to compare different policies on a yearly basis. For example, if someone pays $100 per month, their annualized premium would be $1,200. This is an important metric for life insurers because it represents their recurring revenue from policyholders.

### 3. **Face Value (Death Benefit)**

- **Definition**: The "face value" of a life insurance policy is the amount of money the insurer agrees to pay to the beneficiaries upon the death of the insured person. It is also called the "death benefit."
- **Context in life insurance**: This is the core value of the insurance policy that provides financial protection to beneficiaries. For example, if a policy has a face value of $500,000, that means the beneficiaries will receive $500,000 upon the insured's death, provided the policy is in force and all premiums are up to date.

Each of these terms plays an essential role in determining the financial structure and obligations of a life insurance contract from both the insurer's and policyholder's perspectives.

## Apps and Policies

"Apps" is often short for "applications," and in the context of life insurance, it refers to **insurance applications**. The relationship between "apps" (applications) and "policies" in the life insurance business is tied to the process of how life insurance policies are issued. Here's a breakdown of the relationship:

### 1. **"Apps" (Applications)**:

- **Definition**: In life insurance, an "app" or "application" refers to the formal request submitted by a potential customer (the applicant) to an insurance company to obtain life insurance coverage.
- **Process**: When someone wants to buy life insurance, they fill out an application that provides personal information, health history, lifestyle details, and sometimes undergoes a medical exam. The insurer reviews the application to assess the applicant's risk and determines whether to approve or deny coverage.

### 2. **Policies**:

- **Definition**: A "policy" is the actual contract that is issued by the insurance company if the application is approved. It outlines the terms of coverage, including the premium the policyholder must pay and the face value (death benefit) that will be paid to beneficiaries in the event of the insured’s death.
- **Issuance of Policies**: Policies are issued only after the application process is complete and the insurer has underwritten and approved the applicant's risk.

### **Relationship Between "Apps" and "Policies"**:

- **Applications are the precursor to policies**: The application is the first step in obtaining life insurance. Once an application is submitted, the insurance company evaluates it through a process called underwriting. If the application is approved, the insurer issues a policy.
- **Not all apps become policies**: Not all applications result in a policy being issued. If the insurer determines that the applicant is too high risk (e.g., due to health issues or lifestyle factors), they may decline the application, meaning no policy will be issued.
- **Conversion from app to policy**: When an application is successfully converted into a policy, it becomes a binding contract between the insurer and the policyholder.

In summary, **applications ("apps") are requests** to obtain life insurance coverage, and if approved, **they result in life insurance policies** being issued. The two terms are connected as part of the insurance process: an application leads to a policy, but only after the insurer's review and approval.
