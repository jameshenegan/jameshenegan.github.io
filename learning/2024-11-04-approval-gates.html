<p><strong>Note</strong>: the following proposal was written with the
help of ChatGPT 4o. The prompts mainly asked ChatGPT to summarize some
information from the resources above, with a specific focus on approval
gates.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h2>
<p>To meet compliance needs and improve our ML workflows, we’re
proposing a process for adding <strong>approval gates</strong> at key
steps in our machine learning lifecycle. These approval gates will
ensure that code and models get properly reviewed and tested before they
reach production.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re aiming to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure our code meets quality and compliance standards.</li>
<li>Keep track of changes and approvals for better accountability.</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of deploying untested code or models to
production.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is to set up two main types of approval gates:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Repository-Level Gates</strong> for reviewing code in Azure
DevOps Repos.</li>
<li><strong>Environment-Level Gates</strong> to control deployments
through Azure DevOps Environments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="goals"><strong>2. Goals</strong></h2>
<p>Our main goals here are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build in compliance checkpoints without making the workflow too
heavy.</li>
<li>Make sure all changes are reviewed and tested before going
live.</li>
<li>Create an audit trail for every approval and deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-approach-setting-up-the-approval-gates"><strong>3. The
Approach: Setting Up the Approval Gates</strong></h2>
<h3 id="repository-level-approval-gates"><strong>3.1 Repository-Level
Approval Gates</strong></h3>
<h4 id="why-we-need-this">Why We Need This</h4>
<p>Repository-level gates will help us catch any code issues early by
requiring code reviews and quality checks before changes get merged into
production.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps Repos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll keep all code for ML projects in Azure DevOps Repos, with
separate repositories for each project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Branching Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our setup will include a <strong>main (production) branch</strong>
and <strong>feature branches</strong>. Developers work in feature
branches and only merge into the main branch after approval.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pull Requests</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any changes to the main branch will require a <strong>pull request
(PR)</strong>. PRs will include details on the changes made, and
reviewers will check them for code quality and alignment with our
standards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Branch Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll add policies to make sure PRs only get merged if they:
<ul>
<li>Pass a code review.</li>
<li>Complete automated checks, like linting or style checks.</li>
<li>Successfully build and pass tests.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automated Checks</strong> (optional):</p>
<ul>
<li>We can add extra gates like code analysis or test coverage checks to
catch issues before they get merged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="compliance-perks">Compliance Perks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audit Trail</strong>: Every PR, review, and merge will be
logged in Azure DevOps for easy tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Only designated users can approve
and merge code into the main branch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environment-level-approval-gates"><strong>3.2 Environment-Level
Approval Gates</strong></h3>
<h4 id="why-we-need-this-1">Why We Need This</h4>
<p>Environment-level gates help us control where and when models get
deployed. By setting approval gates between dev, staging, and
production, we make sure only tested models go live.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works-1">How It Works</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Environment Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll create three environments in Azure DevOps:
<strong>Development</strong>, <strong>Staging/QA</strong>, and
<strong>Production</strong>. Each environment will have its own group of
resources. For example, the Development environment may have an Azure ML
Studio workspace, the Staging environment may have a Azure container
instance to host a staging model and web application, and the Production
environment may have a Kubernetes cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Stage Pipelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our pipeline will move models across environments in stages:
<ul>
<li><strong>Development</strong>: Where the model is first deployed and
tested.</li>
<li><strong>Staging/QA</strong>: Where we validate the model in a
production-like setup.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong>: Where the model is finally deployed for
live use.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Approval Process for Environment
Transitions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development to Staging/QA</strong>: Automated deployment—no
manual approval required here.</li>
<li><strong>Staging/QA to Production</strong>: Manual approval is
required. Before moving to production, a reviewer will check:
<ul>
<li>Model performance in staging.</li>
<li>Compliance with any specific requirements.</li>
<li>Logs and test results.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment Access Control</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can
approve deployments to each environment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="compliance-perks-1">Compliance Perks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approval Checks</strong>: We can set up specific people to
approve deployments before they go live.</li>
<li><strong>Logging and Auditing</strong>: Deployment logs and approval
actions are recorded in Azure DevOps, so we have a record for compliance
purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Options</strong>: If an issue is found in
production, we can quickly roll back to a previous version.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integrating-with-azure-machine-learning-studio"><strong>3.3
Integrating with Azure Machine Learning Studio</strong></h3>
<h4 id="why-we-need-this-2">Why We Need This</h4>
<p>We’ll also set up workflows in Azure Machine Learning Studio to
manage the training and deployment of our models.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works-2">How It Works</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Training Pipelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate model training and evaluation in Azure Machine Learning
Studio. We can even trigger a training pipeline as part of the approval
process, making sure the latest model is validated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Versioning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each model version will be registered in Azure ML’s model registry
with all relevant metadata. This way, we have a clear record of every
version we’ve tested.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment Promotions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Azure ML’s deployment tools to push the model across our
environments, with gated approvals ensuring only tested models make it
to production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-logging-for-continuous-compliance"><strong>3.4
Monitoring and Logging for Continuous Compliance</strong></h3>
<p>To keep everything in line with compliance requirements, we’ll set
up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pipeline Monitoring</strong>: Track all pipeline runs,
approvals, and deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Model Monitoring</strong>: Set up checks for data drift and
model performance in production.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logs</strong>: Keep comprehensive logs of all changes,
approvals, and deployments so that everything is trackable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps"><strong>4. Next Steps</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s how we’ll roll out this gated approval process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pilot Project</strong>: Test the setup on a single ML
project to make sure it’s practical.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement</strong>: Adjust as needed based on the pilot,
tweaking policies, approvals, and access controls.</li>
<li><strong>Full Rollout</strong>: Once the pilot is solid, expand the
gated approval process to all ML projects.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation and Training</strong>: Create user guides and
train the team on this new workflow.</li>
</ol>
