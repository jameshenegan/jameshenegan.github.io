Language Models (LLMs) and Their Role in the Livingston Labs Innovation
Day Project</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts
of text data, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text.
They are considered “large” because they contain billions of
parameters—tunable “knobs” that help these models learn patterns in
language at scale.</p>
<p>Before giving our main presentation, we thought it would be helpful
to spend some time clarifying how LLMs work and how we are using them in
this project.</p>
<h3 id="the-relationship-between-llms-and-chatgpt">The Relationship
Between LLMs and ChatGPT</h3>
<p>When you hear the term “large language model,” it’s natural to think
of something like ChatGPT. However, one key point is that ChatGPT itself
is not <strong>just</strong> a large language model. ChatGPT is a web
application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with
a family of large language models (for example, GPT-4, GPT-4 Mini,
etc.).</p>
<p>In other words, ChatGPT consists of both:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A front end</strong> – the user interface that makes it feel
like a chatbot or conversation window.</li>
<li><strong>A back end</strong> – the actual large language models that
process and generate responses.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “chat” format is just one way to interact with LLMs; in reality,
any application can send requests to these models, and you’ll still get
a response, even without a chatbot interface.</p>
<h3 id="other-use-cases-for-large-language-models">Other Use Cases for
Large Language Models</h3>
<p>Beyond conversation, there are many other tasks LLMs can handle.
Unlike a multi-turn chat, these tasks can often be accomplished in a
single “request → response” flow. Below are three examples:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Text Summarization</strong><br />
LLMs can summarize large amounts of text. A typical prompt might
be:<br />
<em>“Please summarize the following text:”</em><br />
followed by the text to be summarized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question-Related Retrieval (Direct Answer)</strong><br />
Here, the LLM answers a specific question using information you provide.
A prompt might look like:<br />
*“You will be provided with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A question</li>
<li>Information that can be used to answer that question.<br />
Please answer the question using only the information provided.”*</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Question-Related Retrieval (Finding Relevant
Passages)</strong><br />
Rather than generating a single, direct answer, the LLM can help locate
relevant information within a large body of text. For example:<br />
<em>“You will be given a question and a large amount of text. I want you
to locate all information in the text that is relevant to the
question.”</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate that LLMs are versatile tools capable of
performing different language-based tasks, whether it’s summarizing
content, generating answers, or pinpointing relevant passages.</p>
<h3 id="why-we-are-using-llms-in-our-project">Why We Are Using LLMs in
Our Project</h3>
<p>Our Innovation Day project focuses less on “chatting” with an LLM and
more on tasks resembling a single request-and-response interaction.
Because of this, we don’t need to rely on a web application interface;
instead, we can send requests directly to a large language model via an
API.</p>
<p>In particular, we are interested in <strong>question-related
retrieval</strong>—having an LLM locate and provide answers from a
specific body of information. This approach helps ensure accuracy by
grounding responses in real data, aligning more closely with our project
goals than open-ended conversations might.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-next-steps">Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
<p>We hope this introduction clarifies how LLMs work and how they differ
from chat-based interfaces. By understanding that ChatGPT is simply one
application of large language models, you can begin to see how LLMs can
be embedded into a wide range of products and services. With this
foundation, we’ll now demonstrate how we’ve tailored these models for
our specific use case at Livingston Labs—ensuring that they reliably
retrieve and synthesize the information we need for innovation.</p>
<h1 id="updates">Updates</h1>
<p>Here are a few suggestions you might consider to make your
introductory presentation clearer and more engaging:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Add a high-level definition of LLMs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before diving into ChatGPT vs. LLMs, you might want a concise, one-
or two-sentence definition or explanation of what “large language
models” are in general terms.
<ul>
<li>For example: <em>“Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems
trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to understand and
generate human-like text.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Include a brief mention of how LLMs are trained or what
makes them “large”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to be overly technical, but a quick note on what
“large” refers to can help non-technical audience members. For example:
<ul>
<li><em>“They are called ‘large’ because they contain billions of
parameters—the tunable ‘knobs’ that help these models ‘learn’ language
patterns.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Highlight other real-world use cases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You already mention summarization and question-related retrieval,
which is great. You could include a few more quick examples (e.g.,
language translation, sentiment analysis, code generation) to show how
versatile LLMs can be.</li>
<li>This can help illustrate that ChatGPT is just <em>one</em>
application among many.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Emphasize the difference between the user interface and
the model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your explanation of ChatGPT’s front end vs. back end is excellent.
You might reinforce it by noting that <em>“Any application, whether a
chat UI or a back-end service, can call the same underlying model to
generate text.”</em> This clarifies that LLMs can be embedded anywhere,
not just in chat interfaces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain “single request → response” vs. “multi-turn
conversation” a bit more</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For some audiences, the idea that you don’t <em>have to</em> chat
with an LLM might be new. You could briefly mention how a single
request-and-response is typically stateless, while multi-turn
conversations rely on context carried over previous messages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide context for your specific project
goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “How We Are Using LLMs in Our Project” section, you mention
the focus on question-related retrieval. Consider adding a short
sentence on <em>why</em> that method aligns with your goals, such as
accuracy, relevance, or efficiency. This helps connect the technology
with your mission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Include a short, forward-looking conclusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You might end by stating how this foundational understanding sets
the stage for what you’ll be showcasing in the main
presentation—something like:
<ul>
<li><em>“With this background, we’ll now show how we’ve tailored LLMs
for our specific use case at Livingston Labs, ensuring accurate,
reliable answers for our innovation needs.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider visuals or simple diagrams</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the presentation format allows, a simple slide showing “User →
Front End (ChatGPT UI) → LLM (e.g., GPT-4)” can really help the audience
visualize the flow of information.</li>
<li>Another diagram could show “User Prompt → LLM →
Summarization/Answer” to illustrate the single request-and-response
approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep it concise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your script is nicely structured and not too long. Just ensure each
section is snappy and highlights the main takeaway so you don’t
overwhelm the audience with details early on.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, you have a solid outline. Small enhancements to emphasize
clarity, connect to real-world examples, and show how LLMs fit into your
specific project will make it even more compelling. Good luck with the
presentation!</p>
