  <body><p>Here’s a cleaned-up version of your transcript with improved clarity,
structure, and flow:</p>
<hr />
<p>We’re going to begin by discussing large language models,
particularly focusing on ChatGPT. When people think about ChatGPT, they
often associate it with the web interface—the version accessible through
a browser. However, it’s important to understand that this is not the
only way to interact with a large language model.</p>
<p>These models are also accessible through something called an API. To
build an intuitive understanding of what a large language model is and
how it works, we can start by considering how we typically interact with
a chatbot. From there, we can explore what’s happening behind the
scenes.</p>
<p>When you converse with a chatbot, each interaction involves a series
of API calls. Every time you send a new message, you’re not just sending
that single message—you’re also including the entire conversation
history up to that point. This provides context, allowing the model to
generate more relevant and coherent responses. Understanding this
process gives insight into how chatbots function at a fundamental
level.</p>
<p>However, our interest in large language models extends beyond chatbot
applications. While chatbots are a common use case, these models have
broader capabilities. One particularly valuable feature is text
summarization. For instance, if you have a long document that you don’t
have time to read in full, you can ask the model to summarize the key
ideas for you. Large language models excel at this task, making them
useful for digesting large amounts of information efficiently.</p>
<p>In our project, this summarization capability plays a crucial role.
However, we’re not just interested in generic summarization; we’re
specifically focused on using large language models to extract relevant
information in response to questions. This differs slightly from
summarization—it involves retrieving and synthesizing information to
provide direct answers.</p>
<p>The process works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We start with a question we want to answer.</li>
<li>We identify a set of texts or sources that likely contain the
answer.</li>
<li>We provide both the question and the reference materials to the
model.</li>
<li>The model then searches through the provided information and
formulates a response.</li>
<li>Importantly, we also want the model to indicate which sources it
used when generating its answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures that responses are not only accurate but also
transparent, allowing us to trace back the information to its original
source.</p>
<p>Taking this a step further, we can ask: What if we could automate the
process of gathering reference materials? Instead of manually curating
relevant texts, we could streamline this step by automatically searching
for and compiling useful sources. This is where the concept of a
generative engine comes in.</p>
<p>A generative engine can automate the process of retrieving reference
material by leveraging the internet to search for information
programmatically. Once the relevant materials are collected, they can be
structured and passed to the large language model for processing. This
automation makes the system more efficient, reducing the need for manual
intervention and allowing for real-time information retrieval.</p>
<p>In summary, while large language models are often associated with
chatbots, their potential extends far beyond simple conversations. They
can summarize information, extract answers from relevant sources, and
even automate parts of the research process. By integrating these
capabilities into a generative engine, we can build powerful tools that
streamline information retrieval and synthesis.</p>
