<p>Below is a detailed summary of the “Manage Azure Machine Learning
registries” article, covering its main concepts and step-by-step
guidance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview-of-azure-machine-learning-registries">Overview of Azure
Machine Learning Registries</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assets vs. Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> (e.g., models, environments, components,
datasets) are “durable” and can be shared across different workspaces
and possibly different regions.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> (e.g., compute, jobs, endpoints) are
“transient” and specific to a particular workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Registries:</strong><br />
Azure Machine Learning registries allow you to centrally store and
manage these <em>durable</em> ML assets. You can then use them in
multiple workspaces (even across regions) to streamline sharing and
collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Region Replication:</strong><br />
When you create a registry, Azure automatically provisions blob storage
accounts in each supported region and a single Azure Container Registry
(ACR) replicated across those regions. This replication improves
performance (low latency) and redundancy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Azure CLI (v2) with the ml extension installed</strong>
<ul>
<li>See <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli">Install,
set up, and use the CLI (v2)</a> for instructions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>An existing Azure Machine Learning workspace</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have one, follow the steps in the CLI (v2)
documentation to create a new workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Permission level</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should be an “Owner” or “Contributor” on the subscription or
resource group where you intend to create the registry. This ensures you
can create and manage registry resources.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="planning-before-you-create-a-registry">Planning Before You
Create a Registry</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Choose a Name</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pick a name that reflects its broad sharing scope within your
organization (e.g., group, division, entire org).</li>
<li>Name uniqueness is enforced <strong>within your Microsoft Entra
tenant</strong>.</li>
<li>The name can’t be changed after creation because it becomes part of
the ID used for models, environments, and components.</li>
<li>Valid name criteria: 2–32 characters; alphanumeric, underscores,
hyphens allowed (must start with an alphanumeric).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Select Azure Regions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Decide which regions to replicate assets across; consider where your
current and near-future workspaces reside.</li>
<li>You must define a <strong>primary region</strong> (unchangeable
later) and a list of other replication regions (which can be updated
later).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Check Permissions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Confirm you have the “Owner” or “Contributor” role on the
subscription or resource group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="creating-a-registry">Creating a Registry</h2>
<p>You can create a registry via the <strong>Azure CLI</strong>,
<strong>Azure Machine Learning Studio</strong>, <strong>Azure
portal</strong>, or <strong>REST API</strong>. Below focuses on the CLI
approach using YAML:</p>
<h3 id="create-a-yaml-definition-registry.yml">1. Create a YAML
Definition (registry.yml)</h3>
<p>A basic example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode yaml"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> DemoRegistry1</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">tags</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">description</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Basic registry with one primary region and additional regions</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">foo</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> bar</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">location</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> eastus</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">replication_locations</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="fu">location</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> eastus</span></span>

<ul>
<li><code>location</code> is the primary region (here,
<code>eastus</code>).</li>
<li><code>replication_locations</code> includes the primary region
(again) plus any additional regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Use
<code>az account list-locations -o table</code> to find the proper
“no-space, lower-case” names for regions.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-registry-create-command">2. Run the Registry Create
Command</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre

<ul>
<li>This command provisions the registry with the specified regions and
tags.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="specifying-storage-account-type-and-sku-optional">Specifying
Storage Account Type and SKU (Optional)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Azure Storage offers various account types (e.g., Standard_LRS,
Standard_GRS).</li>
<li>You can configure <strong>Data Lake Storage Gen2</strong> by setting
<code>storage_account_hns: true</code> or use <strong>Azure Blob
Storage</strong> by setting it to <code>false</code>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Each <code>location</code> block can override the default storage
type (e.g., to enable hierarchical namespace for Data Lake Gen2 or set a
specific SKU).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="managing-registry-access-and-permissions">Managing Registry
Access and Permissions</h2>
<p>Deciding who can <strong>read assets, create assets, or manage the
entire registry</strong> is done via Azure role-based access control
(RBAC). The main options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Allow Users to Read (Use) Assets Only</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assign the built-in <strong>Reader</strong> role, or</li>
<li>Create a custom role that includes:
<ul>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/read</code></li>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/read</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Allow Users to Create and Use Assets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the read permissions above, grant:
<ul>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/write</code></li>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/delete</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note that built-in <strong>Contributor</strong> and
<strong>Owner</strong> roles also give these permissions but include
broader abilities (like managing registries themselves).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Allow Users to Create and Manage Registries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assign built-in <strong>Contributor</strong> or
<strong>Owner</strong> roles, or create a custom role that includes:
<ul>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/write</code></li>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/delete</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This lets users create, update, or delete entire registries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The built-in Contributor and Owner roles
let users do everything, including registry creation. If you only want
them to create assets (not the registry itself), you should create a
custom role.</p>

<h1 id="question">Question</h1>
<p>suppose i want to train a model in a dev AML workspace, then register
that model to a Registry, then use the model in a prod AML workspace.
should I create the registry in the dev AML workspace or in the prod
workspace? does that question make sense? for more context: our dev
workspace lives in one resource group and our prod workspace lives in
another resource group. maybe the real question is: which resource group
should the registry belong to?</p>
<h1 id="response">Response</h1>
<p>It’s not a strict requirement, but using separate resource groups for
your dev and prod workspaces is generally considered a best practice.
Here are some advantages and disadvantages to consider:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isolation and Security:</strong><br />
By placing dev and prod in separate resource groups, you isolate
production assets from development ones. This means that any accidental
changes or issues in the dev group won’t impact your prod environment.
It also allows you to apply stricter security and access control
policies to production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tailored Governance and Policy Management:</strong><br />
Different resource groups can have their own policies, role-based access
controls (RBAC), and management rules. For instance, you might want to
enforce tighter compliance rules and auditing on the prod resource
group, while keeping dev more flexible for experimentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost Management and Monitoring:</strong><br />
Segregating environments makes it easier to track and manage costs, as
you can monitor resource usage, spending, and billing separately for dev
and prod.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lifecycle Management:</strong><br />
Development environments are often more transient. Having them in a
separate resource group makes it simpler to clean up, redeploy, or
experiment without affecting the production workload.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Resource Permissions Setup:</strong><br />
When you separate environments, you need to ensure that identities
(users or service principals) have the appropriate permissions to
operate across resource groups. For example, if you want a model trained
in dev to be registered in a registry in the prod resource group, you’ll
need to configure RBAC carefully. While not inherently difficult, it
does add a layer of complexity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administrative Overhead:</strong><br />
Managing multiple resource groups can introduce some extra
administrative overhead, especially if you have many environments or if
the processes for cross-environment communication aren’t
streamlined.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complexity in Automation:</strong><br />
Deploying resources that span multiple resource groups may require
additional automation steps (for example, in your CI/CD pipelines) to
handle resource group-specific configurations and dependencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using separate resource groups for dev and prod environments offers
clear benefits in terms of isolation, security, and governance. However,
it does require careful planning around cross-resource permissions and
might add some administrative complexity. Overall, the
benefits—especially for critical production environments—often outweigh
the additional setup work.</p>
<h1 id="question-1">Question</h1>
<p>I’m a little confused about something with respect to Azure Machine
Learning. If I train a model using MLFlow in an AML workspace, then I
see an option to “register” a model. If I do that, then I can go to the
“Models” tab of my AML workspace. There, I can see my model on something
called a models list. Is that the same thing as a registry?</p>
<h1 id="response-1">Response</h1>
<p>No, they’re not exactly the same thing. When you register a model in
your AML workspace, that model appears in the workspace’s “Models”
list—this is a local registry for that specific workspace. In contrast,
an Azure Machine Learning registry is a separate, centralized repository
that can store ML assets (models, environments, components, etc.) and
share them across multiple workspaces and even regions.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Models List in AML Workspace:</strong><br />
Shows the models registered within that particular workspace. It’s a
workspace-scoped asset store.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Azure Machine Learning Registry:</strong><br />
A dedicated, central repository designed to enable asset sharing across
different AML workspaces, with additional features like multi-region
replication for improved access and governance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So if you simply register a model through MLflow in your dev
workspace, you’ll see it in the local models list—not in an AML registry
unless you’ve specifically configured and linked one for cross-workspace
sharing.</p>
<h1 id="question-2">Question</h1>
<p>i have found another article. just to help me understand: the
following article is about registering it to the “local models list”,
not a registry, right? here is the article — Work with registered models
in Azure Machine Learning</p>
<h1 id="response-2">Response</h1>
<p>Yes, that’s correct. The article you found focuses on how to register
models to the local model registry within an Azure Machine Learning
workspace—the list you see in the “Models” tab—rather than a separate,
central registry that shares assets across workspaces.</p>
<p>In this context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Local Model Registry (Models List):</strong><br />
When you register a model via the Studio UI, CLI, or Python SDK, it
becomes part of your workspace’s model registry. This lets you version,
organize, and manage your models within that specific
workspace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Centralized AML Registry:</strong><br />
A dedicated AML registry is a separate repository designed for sharing
assets (models, environments, components) across multiple workspaces and
regions. This is not what the article is describing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the article details the processes to register and manage models
locally in your workspace—not using the cross-workspace registry
mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Below is a detailed summary of the article “Share models, components,
and environments across workspaces with registries”:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Azure Machine Learning registries are designed to enable
collaboration across workspaces by centrally storing ML assets—models,
components, and environments. This allows teams to share and reuse these
assets across development, testing, and production workspaces,
preserving the full lineage (training data, code, metrics, and
environment) and promoting reproducibility.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="key-scenarios">Key Scenarios</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Cross-Workspace MLOps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Train a model in a development workspace and deploy it in test and
production.</li>
<li>Maintain end-to-end traceability from training to deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing and Reuse Across Teams:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Publish trained models along with their components and environments
into a central catalog.</li>
<li>Enable colleagues from different teams to discover and reuse these
assets in their own experiments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Azure Subscription &amp; AML Resources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An active Azure subscription.</li>
<li>An Azure Machine Learning registry and at least one AML
workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Azure CLI with the ml extension (or the Python SDK v2).</li>
<li>Properly configured defaults (subscription, workspace, resource
group, and region).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Region Compatibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The workspace’s Azure region must be supported by the registry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="main-steps-and-processes">Main Steps and Processes</h2>
<h3 id="creating-an-environment-in-the-registry">1. Creating an
Environment in the Registry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />
An environment defines the Docker container and Python dependencies
needed to run training jobs or deploy models.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use a YAML file (e.g., <code>env_train.yml</code>) that specifies
the environment details such as base Docker image (e.g.,
<code>python:3.8</code>) and required packages.</li>
<li>Create the environment in the registry using the CLI command with
the <code>--registry-name</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Verify and list the environments in the registry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-a-component-in-the-registry">2. Creating a Component in
the Registry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />
Components are reusable building blocks of ML pipelines that package
code, commands, and dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Components stored in a registry can be used across any
workspace.</li>
<li>Encourages modularity and collaboration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Define the component in a YAML file (e.g., <code>train.yml</code>),
specifying inputs (like training data), outputs (such as a trained
model), and the command to run.</li>
<li>Reference the environment in the component definition using the
registry URI.</li>
<li>Create the component in the registry using the Azure CLI or Python
SDK.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="running-a-pipeline-job-using-a-registry-component">3. Running a
Pipeline Job Using a Registry Component</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong><br />
Run a training pipeline in a workspace that leverages a component stored
in the registry.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Update the pipeline job YAML (e.g.,
<code>single-job-pipeline.yml</code>) to reference the component from
the registry.</li>
<li>Submit the job in the workspace, ensuring compute resources and data
paths are defined locally.</li>
<li>This approach enables you to use the same training logic across
different workspaces without duplicating the component definition.</li>

<h3 id="registering-and-sharing-a-model-in-the-registry">4. Registering
and Sharing a Model in the Registry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approaches:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directly from Local Files:</strong><br />
Download the model output from a training job and then create the model
asset in the registry.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing from a Workspace:</strong><br />
First register the model in the workspace and then share it (copy it) to
the registry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Centralizes model management.</li>
<li>Preserves links to training jobs and lineage data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying-a-model-from-the-registry">5. Deploying a Model from
the Registry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create an online endpoint in the desired workspace.</li>
<li>Update a deployment YAML file (e.g., <code>deploy.yml</code>) to
reference the model from the registry.</li>
<li>Deploy the model to the online endpoint and test by submitting
inference requests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
This enables a seamless promotion of models from a central registry to
any workspace (e.g., production), maintaining a consistent deployment
process.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reusable Assets:</strong><br />
Storing environments, components, and models in a registry creates a
shared asset catalog that improves collaboration and accelerates
deployment across multiple teams and workspaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lineage and Governance:</strong><br />
By sharing assets via a registry, you preserve the full lineage
information (code, metrics, training data, etc.) and enforce governance
and version control across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Management:</strong><br />
The article also provides guidance on cloning example repositories,
setting up SDK client connections, and cleaning up resources (e.g.,
deleting online endpoints) to control costs.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Overall, the article details how to build, register, share, and
deploy ML assets centrally through an Azure Machine Learning registry,
making cross-workspace collaboration and production-grade MLOps easier
and more consistent.</p>
<h1 id="question-3">Question</h1>
<p>now suppose i am working at a company. my role at the company is
“data scientist” but I am helping set up the architecture for mlops. but
the main thing is that I won’t have “ownership” permissions for
anything. but i still need to make a request to IT so that they can set
up resources for us. we currently have an dev aml workspace in one
resource group and a prod aml workspace in another resource group. we’re
thinking about setting up a registry in the same resource group as the
prod workspace. i don’t think the IT team knows too much about this or
even what we’re trying to do. but we want to be able to train a model in
the dev workspace (where we have access) and then register that model to
the registry. we will be doing this as part of an azure devops / azure
machine learning pipeline . basically, i want you general advice on how
to do this. is this a reasonable approach so far? what information
should i provide in our request to set up the registry?</p>
<h1 id="response-3">Response</h1>
<p>Your approach is sound and aligns with best practices for MLOps in
Azure Machine Learning. Even though you’re not an owner, you can work
with IT to set up a central registry that both your dev and prod
workspaces can access. Here are some key points and recommendations you
can share with your IT team:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-a-centralized-registry-makes-sense">Why a Centralized
Registry Makes Sense</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared Asset Repository:</strong><br />
The AML registry is designed to store and version models, components,
and environments so they can be used across multiple workspaces. This is
ideal for your scenario, where you train a model in the dev workspace
and then want to register and deploy it in production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Workspace Integration:</strong><br />
Although your dev workspace exists in a different resource group, the
registry (even if created in the prod resource group) is accessible
across workspaces as long as the proper permissions are set up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance and Security:</strong><br />
Placing the registry in the prod resource group typically aligns with
stricter governance and compliance requirements. This also makes it
easier to control access and manage production assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-information-to-provide-in-your-request">Key Information to
Provide in Your Request</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Registry Location and Resource Group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> Create an Azure Machine Learning registry
in the resource group where the production AML workspace resides.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This centralizes production assets and
aligns with your governance policies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Access and Permissions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Resource Access:</strong><br />
Ensure that the registry allows access from both the prod and dev
workspaces. Specifically, the service principals or user groups
associated with your dev AML workspace (and the Azure DevOps pipeline)
need appropriate RBAC permissions (e.g., Contributor or a custom role
with write access for asset registration).</li>
<li><strong>Details to Include:</strong><br />
Ask IT to grant the necessary permissions for model registration,
management, and retrieval. This might include permissions like:
<ul>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/read</code></li>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/write</code></li>
<li><code>Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/delete</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Specifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Region Replication:</strong><br />
If your organization requires low latency or redundancy across regions,
note whether multi-region replication is needed.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Options:</strong><br />
Mention if you have any requirements for the underlying storage account
type (e.g., Standard_LRS) or if you prefer Azure Blob Storage versus
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (with hierarchical namespace enabled).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with Pipelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure DevOps / AML Pipeline Usage:</strong><br />
Explain that the registry is a key part of your automated ML pipeline.
You train models in the dev workspace, register them to the central
registry, and then deploy them in the prod workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Lineage and Versioning:</strong><br />
Emphasize the need for versioning and lineage tracking, which the
registry supports, to maintain a clear audit trail from model training
to deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reasonable Approach:</strong><br />
Training in the dev workspace and registering models to a central
registry in the production resource group is not only feasible but
recommended for centralized management and governance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IT Request Essentials:</strong><br />
Provide details about the registry’s location (prod resource group),
access requirements (RBAC for cross-workspace usage), desired storage
configuration, and its role in your Azure DevOps-driven MLOps
pipeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By clearly outlining these requirements, you’ll help the IT team
understand both the technical and business needs, making it easier for
them to provision the right resources and set the appropriate
permissions.</p>
<h1 id="question-4">Question</h1>
<p>one point i’d like clarificaiton on: when you say – -Ask IT to grant
the necessary permissions for model registration, management, and
retrieval. This might include permissions like:
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/read
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/write
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/registries/assets/delete — do you mean
that <em>I</em> need these permissions? Or something like a “service
principal” needs those permissions?</p>
<h1 id="response-4">Response</h1>
<p>It applies to whichever identity is executing the registration
actions. In an automated pipeline scenario, that’s typically a service
principal (or managed identity) that needs the permissions. If you’re
doing these tasks manually through your account, then your user account
would need them. The key is that the identity (whether it’s yours or a
service principal) used to register, manage, and retrieve models must
have the required RBAC permissions on the registry.</p>
<h1 id="question-5">Question</h1>
<p>Finally, can you help me understand the details about how this works
in practice? do i first register the model from the dev workspace to the
“local models list” in that workspace and then register it to the
registry? how does this work in terms of the pipelines we’re building
with azure devops and azure machine learning?</p>
<h1 id="response-5">Response</h1>
<p>In practice, there are a couple of common workflows for promoting
models from a dev environment to production using Azure Machine Learning
and Azure DevOps pipelines. Here’s an overview of how it can work:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="option-1-two-step-registration">Option 1: Two-Step
Registration</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Register Locally in Dev Workspace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After training in the dev workspace, you first register the model in
that workspace. This makes it part of the local models list and lets you
validate and test the model.</li>
<li>This registration is often done as part of your training pipeline
using the Azure ML CLI or Python SDK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Promote (Share) the Model to the Central
Registry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the model is validated, you then “promote” or share it to the
central registry (which, in your case, resides in the production
resource group).</li>
<li>This is typically done using the <code>az ml model share</code>
command (or an equivalent SDK call), which copies the model asset along
with its metadata to the central registry.</li>
<li>Your production deployment pipelines then reference the model in the
central registry rather than the dev workspace’s local list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="option-2-direct-registration-to-the-central-registry">Option 2:
Direct Registration to the Central Registry</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Registration:</strong><br />
If permissions and pipeline configuration allow, you can register the
model directly to the central registry from the dev workspace.
<ul>
<li>In this case, you’d use commands with the
<code>--registry-name</code> flag so that the model is immediately
stored in the central registry.</li>
<li>This approach eliminates the intermediate step of having the model
in the dev workspace’s local models list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-this-fits-into-your-pipelines">How This Fits into Your
Pipelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps Pipelines:</strong><br />
Your CI/CD pipeline can have stages that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Train and Validate:</strong><br />
Run the training job in the dev workspace and register the model (either
locally or directly to the registry).</li>
<li><strong>Promotion:</strong><br />
If the model is first registered locally, include a step that promotes
the model to the central registry after passing tests.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment:</strong><br />
Deploy the model from the central registry to production endpoints. The
deployment pipeline will reference the model using its registry
URI.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Why This Two-Step Process Is Useful:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It allows you to verify the model in a controlled dev environment
before promoting it.</li>
<li>It preserves a clear lineage: you can track where the model came
from (its training job, data, environment, etc.) before it’s
shared.</li>
<li>It separates development from production, aligning with best
practices in governance and model management.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-3">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Registration:</strong><br />
Often, you first register the model in the dev workspace to test and
validate it.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion/Sharing:</strong><br />
Then, you promote or share that model to the central registry, where
production systems can access it.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline Integration:</strong><br />
Both steps can be automated in your Azure DevOps pipelines, ensuring
that your MLOps workflow maintains clear lineage and proper separation
between development and production environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the approach that best fits your team’s permissions and
workflow preferences. If you have full control over the pipeline’s
service principal and cross-resource access is configured correctly,
direct registration may streamline the process. Otherwise, a two-step
process helps ensure quality control before production deployment.</p>
