  <body><h1 id="github">GitHub</h1>
<p>Yes, it’s absolutely possible to use GitHub for documentation. In
fact, there are two main ways to store documentation on GitHub:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>GitHub Wikis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each GitHub repository can have its own wiki, which is essentially a
mini documentation site.</li>
<li>The wiki is backed by a separate Git repository, so you can clone
it, edit pages locally, and push changes.</li>
<li>You can write pages in Markdown, create links between pages, and
even restrict access in private repositories (if you’re using GitHub
Enterprise or a paid plan).</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: Easy to set up, integrates naturally with the
project’s main repo, and supports version history.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Format and styling options are limited
compared to dedicated documentation platforms, and navigation can feel
less robust for very large documentation sets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Pages (Static Site Hosting)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can use GitHub Pages to host a static site generated from your
repo (for instance, using a static site generator like Jekyll,
Docusaurus, or MkDocs).</li>
<li>This allows you to create a more polished, user-friendly
documentation website, often with theming, a sidebar navigation, search,
and other features.</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: Highly customizable, good for open-source or
public-facing documentation, integrates well with Git-based
workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires some setup—learning or configuring a
static site generator. Also, private repositories require a paid plan to
use GitHub Pages privately (unless you’re on GitHub Enterprise).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-use-github-for-documentation"><strong>Why Use GitHub for
Documentation?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Git-based workflows make it easy
to track changes, revert to older versions, and enforce pull request
reviews for edits.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Familiarity</strong>: Many technical teams already
use GitHub for code; documentation stored alongside code can streamline
contributions.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: For public/open-source
projects, GitHub Wikis and GitHub Pages are generally free to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-drawbacks"><strong>Potential Drawbacks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration Model</strong>: Non-developers might find
Git-based workflows less intuitive than a point-and-click wiki editor
like Confluence or Notion.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Rich Media / Structure</strong>: GitHub Wikis don’t
always have the same advanced features (e.g., drag-and-drop formatting,
inline commenting, dynamic page hierarchies) that dedicated
documentation tools provide.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control &amp; Permissions</strong>: GitHub’s
permission model might be more granular in Enterprise-level plans, but
for smaller setups, you typically have to grant read/write to the whole
repo.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>In short</strong>: GitHub definitely supports documentation,
either through its <strong>Wiki</strong> feature (simple, built-in wiki
pages) or <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> (static site hosting for more
polished docs). If your team is already comfortable with Git and
primarily writes technical content, it can be a solid, cost-effective
solution for version-controlled documentation. If you need a more
user-friendly, non-developer-focused interface or robust wiki features,
you might prefer specialized documentation platforms.</p>
<h1 id="azure-devops">Azure DevOps</h1>
<p><strong>Yes, you can absolutely store Markdown files in an Azure
DevOps repo and then render them into a documentation site.</strong>
This approach is similar to using Git-based wikis (like GitHub Wikis or
GitBook) but runs in the Azure DevOps ecosystem, which you might already
be using for source control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.
Below are some things to consider:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="using-azure-devops-wiki-vs.-markdown-in-a-repo"><strong>1. Using
Azure DevOps Wiki vs. Markdown in a Repo</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps Wiki</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Azure DevOps provides a built-in wiki feature where each page is
written in Markdown.</li>
<li>It’s easy to set up, and the wiki is automatically linked with your
project.</li>
<li>You don’t have to manage a separate repository for the
documentation—though it can be cloned and edited offline if needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Markdown in a Repo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can place your <code>.md</code> files directly in a repo (e.g.,
a dedicated “documentation” repo or your existing code repo).</li>
<li>This can be combined with pipelines to <strong>generate a static
site</strong> (HTML) using a tool such as <strong>MkDocs</strong>,
<strong>Docusaurus</strong>, or any other static site generator.</li>
<li>Once rendered, you can host the generated HTML pages in various
ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure DevOps Artifacts</strong> (less common for hosting
documentation)</li>
<li><strong>Azure Storage + Static Website</strong> feature</li>
<li><strong>Azure Web App</strong> (for more complex setups)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="setting-up-a-static-site-generator"><strong>2. Setting Up a
Static Site Generator</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to do the repo + pipeline + generated site approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Pick a Static Site Generator (SSG)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MkDocs</strong> (simple Markdown-based docs, optional MkDocs
Material theme for a professional look)</li>
<li><strong>Docusaurus</strong> (popular for open-source or API docs,
React-based)</li>
<li><strong>Hugo</strong>, <strong>Jekyll</strong>, etc. (many options
exist)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Configure a Pipeline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In your <strong>Azure DevOps pipeline</strong>, install the SSG
(e.g., <code>pip install mkdocs</code> or
<code>npm install docusaurus</code>).</li>
<li>Run the build script to <strong>convert Markdown →
HTML</strong>.</li>
<li>Output the generated site into a folder (usually <code>site/</code>
or <code>build/</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy the HTML</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong>: A straightforward option if
you want a free-tier static site with automated deployment from Azure
DevOps.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Web App</strong>: You can zip up the site folder and
deploy it as a web app.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Storage</strong>: Enable static website hosting on a
storage account, then upload the files.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="pros-of-markdown-azure-devops-repo"><strong>3. Pros of Markdown
+ Azure DevOps Repo</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Version Control &amp; Familiar Workflow</strong>: All the
benefits of Git-based versioning—pull requests, code reviews, branching,
tagging releases—apply to docs.</li>
<li><strong>Developer-Friendly</strong>: Markdown is lightweight and
easy to use, especially for those accustomed to writing in plain
text.</li>
<li><strong>Full Customization</strong>: A static site generator allows
you to tailor the look, navigation, and structure exactly how you
want.</li>
<li><strong>One-Stop Shop</strong>: Your code, issues, pipelines, and
documentation can all live in Azure DevOps, simplifying access control
and discoverability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="cons-considerations"><strong>4. Cons /
Considerations</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Learning Curve for Non-Tech Staff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-developers might find “clone repo → edit Markdown → push changes
→ pipeline build” more daunting than a point-and-click wiki editor.</li>
<li>You can mitigate this by using the <strong>Azure DevOps web
interface</strong> to edit Markdown files, but the process may still be
less intuitive than a dedicated documentation tool.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Setup &amp; Maintenance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll have to configure a pipeline and maintain the static site
generator. Small overhead, but it’s extra work.</li>
<li>If your documentation is large or you want advanced features
(search, versioning, translations), you’ll need to customize your SSG
accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Real-Time Collaboration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown in a repo doesn’t inherently provide real-time
collaborative editing, unlike some wikis (Confluence, Notion). You can
only see changes after they’re committed/pushed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Permission Granularity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the repo is controlled at the project or branch level. If
you have specialized permissions requirements (e.g., certain pages
visible only to certain roles), you may need complex branching or
multiple repos.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><strong>5. Putting It All
Together</strong></h2>
<p>If your team is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable with Git workflows (or at least can handle pull requests
for doc changes).</li>
<li>Already using Azure DevOps for CI/CD and code management.</li>
<li>Interested in controlling the presentation and structure of your
docs in a <strong>highly customizable</strong> way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <strong>storing Markdown in an Azure DevOps repo, generating
HTML via a pipeline, and hosting a static site</strong> is a very
powerful method. You’ll get version control, a professional-looking
site, and minimal licensing costs (since you’re leveraging your existing
Azure DevOps subscription).</p>
<p>If, however, your organization has a large number of
<strong>non-technical contributors</strong> or requires <strong>robust,
user-friendly wiki editing</strong>, you might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure DevOps Wiki</strong> for simpler, browser-based
editing.</li>
<li><strong>SharePoint</strong> with Word docs if your company is
strictly Microsoft-based and prefers a more familiar interface.</li>
<li>A specialized tool like <strong>Confluence, Notion, or
GitBook</strong> if you need advanced features (e.g., dynamic search,
custom permission levels, or real-time collaboration).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Using Markdown in an Azure DevOps repo</strong> is a solid
approach for a developer-centric documentation workflow, especially if
you want to <strong>automate</strong> publishing a <strong>clean, static
website</strong>. It provides robust version control and integrates
seamlessly with your existing pipelines. The main trade-offs involve a
slightly higher setup cost, less real-time collaboration, and a steeper
learning curve for non-technical users.</p>
