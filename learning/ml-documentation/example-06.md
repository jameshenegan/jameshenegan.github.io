## **2. Data Management**

### 2.1. **Raw Data Sources**

The data used to create the training dataset for the model comes from several sources within the real estate company’s CRM and marketing systems. Below are the main **raw datasets**:

- **Customer Interaction Data** (`InteractionTable`):

  - Contains records of customer interactions with the company’s website and sales team.
  - **Columns**: `InteractionID`, `CustomerID`, `InteractionType`, `InteractionDate`, `PropertyViewed`, `TimeSpent`, etc.
  - **Source**: Real estate CRM system.
  - **Raw Characteristics**: Includes every interaction (e.g., property searches, email clicks, and phone calls), with some duplicated entries and inconsistencies in `InteractionType`.

- **Customer Demographics Data** (`CustomerTable`):
  - Contains demographic details for potential customers.
  - **Columns**: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `IncomeLevel`, `Location`, etc.
  - **Source**: Marketing and CRM databases.
  - **Raw Characteristics**: Missing values in `IncomeLevel`, and a small number of duplicate entries in `CustomerID`.
- **Transaction Data** (`TransactionTable`):

  - Contains records of completed property sales.
  - **Columns**: `TransactionID`, `CustomerID`, `PropertyID`, `SaleDate`, `SaleAmount`, etc.
  - **Source**: Property sales database.
  - **Raw Characteristics**: Only includes data on customers who successfully bought a property, creating potential class imbalance for the binary classification task.

- **Property Data** (`PropertyTable`):
  - Contains property information such as location, size, and price range.
  - **Columns**: `PropertyID`, `Location`, `PriceRange`, `PropertyType`, `AvailabilityStatus`, etc.
  - **Source**: Real estate listing database.
  - **Raw Characteristics**: Inconsistent `PriceRange` labels and missing values in `AvailabilityStatus`.

### 2.2. **Raw Data Preprocessing**

Before building the training dataset, several preprocessing steps were applied to clean, transform, and structure the raw data:

- **Data Cleaning**:

  - **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate rows were identified and removed from `CustomerTable` and `InteractionTable` based on `CustomerID` and `InteractionID`.
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the `IncomeLevel` field from `CustomerTable` were filled using median income levels based on `Location` and `AgeGroup`. Missing values in the `AvailabilityStatus` field from `PropertyTable` were imputed with “unknown.”

- **Data Transformation**:

  - **Join Tables**: The raw tables were joined based on common keys (`CustomerID`, `PropertyID`) to create a unified dataset for further feature extraction.
  - **Feature Engineering**: New features were derived:
    - `CustomerEngagementScore`: Aggregated score based on the number of website interactions, time spent per interaction, and number of properties viewed.
    - `PurchaseRecency`: Difference between the most recent interaction and the last sale date for customers who bought a property.
    - `PropertyInterestLevel`: Ratio of interactions for each property relative to its availability status.

- **Handling Class Imbalance**: To address the imbalance between customers who purchased a property and those who did not, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to balance the classes in the training data.

### 2.3. **Training Dataset**

The final **training dataset** was created after preprocessing the raw data. It contains a combination of features derived from customer interactions, demographics, and property data, and a target label indicating whether the customer converted into a buyer.

- **Final Dataset Structure**:

  - **Features**: `CustomerAge`, `CustomerEngagementScore`, `IncomeLevel`, `Location`, `PropertyInterestLevel`, `PurchaseRecency`, etc.
  - **Target Variable**: `Converted` (1 = customer bought property, 0 = customer did not convert).

- **Data Anonymization**: Columns such as `CustomerID`, `TransactionID`, and `PropertyID` were removed from the training dataset to protect customer privacy and to ensure that no identifying information was included.

- **Final Shape**: The training dataset has 50,000 rows and 20 features after preprocessing, feature engineering, and class balancing.

## **3. Model Development and Performance**

### 3.1. **Model Purpose**

- The objective of the model is to predict the likelihood of a potential lead (customer) converting into a buyer. The model will enable the sales team to focus on high-potential leads, improving the company’s efficiency in selling properties.

### 3.2. **Model Type and Algorithms**

- **Model Type**: Binary classification model.
- **Chosen Algorithm**: **Random Forest Classifier**.
  - **Reasoning**: Random Forest was selected due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data and to provide feature importance metrics, which help understand which factors most influence a customer’s decision to buy.

### 3.3. **Model Output**

- **Output Format**: The model generates a probability score between 0 and 1 for each lead, representing the likelihood that the lead will convert into a buyer. A threshold of **0.6** is used to classify leads into potential buyers (1) or non-buyers (0).
- **Business Use**: The predicted high-potential leads (those classified as buyers) are sent to the sales team for targeted follow-ups.

### 3.4. **Model Performance**

- **Evaluation Metrics**:

  - **Accuracy**: 87%
  - **Precision**: 80% (to ensure that the leads identified as likely buyers are actually good candidates).
  - **Recall**: 70% (to capture as many true buyers as possible).
  - **F1 Score**: 0.74
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.89 (indicates good discrimination between buyers and non-buyers).

- **Cross-Validation**: The model was validated using **5-fold cross-validation**, showing consistent performance across different subsets of the data.

## **4. Deployment and Governance**

### 4.1. **Deployment and Maintenance**

- **Deployment Environment**: The model is deployed on **Azure Machine Learning Service**, where it is available as a REST API that the sales team can query for real-time lead scoring.
- **Model Monitoring**: The model’s performance is monitored weekly, and retraining is scheduled every six months or earlier if performance drops significantly.

### 4.2. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**

- **Data Privacy**: Customer PII, such as `CustomerID`, was excluded from the model to comply with **GDPR** and ensure data privacy. All data is stored securely on Azure, with encryption applied at rest and in transit.
- **Fairness**: A fairness audit was conducted to ensure that the model does not disproportionately favor or penalize specific demographic groups (e.g., by age or income level).

### 4.3

. **Monitoring and Retraining**

- **Performance Monitoring**: Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are tracked over time. If any metric drops by more than 5%, the model will be retrained using updated data.
- **Data Drift Detection**: A data drift monitoring system is in place to detect significant changes in customer behavior or property interest trends, which would trigger earlier retraining.

### 4.4. **Security and Access Control**

- **Access Control**: Access to the model and customer data is managed through **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the model and data.
- **Audit Logs**: All interactions with the model and data are logged and audited regularly for compliance.

## **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**

The lead generation model for the real estate company is now operational, delivering real-time insights on high-potential leads. The model is helping the sales team prioritize their efforts, improving lead conversion rates. Moving forward, the model will be retrained periodically, and the inclusion of new features, such as customer preferences and feedback, will be explored to further enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
