<p>MOSTLY AI has launched the world’s first industry-grade open-source
toolkit for synthetic data, aimed at enhancing AI and machine learning
(ML) development. The toolkit addresses significant challenges in data
availability and quality for training models, which often have limited
access due to privacy concerns and low consent rates from data owners.
Traditional data anonymization methods frequently result in subpar data
quality, hindering the effectiveness of AI/ML models.</p>
<p>Synthetic data serves as a viable alternative, being both
privacy-compliant and capable of improving model performance by
simulating rare events and upwardsampling limited datasets. This
approach can also enhance fairness and explainability in AI, critical
areas currently lacking adequate practices. As noted, many algorithms in
production suffer from bias, which can lead to unethical outcomes and
business risks, emphasizing the need for regulatory adherence and
transparency.</p>
<p>Using synthetic data can help mitigate bias, as evidenced by cases
where racial and gender biases were significantly reduced in datasets.
Moreover, synthetic data facilitates auditing by providing a means to
validate AI models without exposing sensitive original data, supporting
compliance with emerging AI regulations.</p>
<p>The content encourages users to experiment with synthetic data
through their platform, offering resources and guidance for various use
cases in AI/ML development.</p>
