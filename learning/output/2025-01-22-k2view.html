<ul>
<li>K2view offers a patented Micro-Database technology, which organizes
each customer’s data dynamically for more precise retrieval, akin to
chunking and embedding used for document data.</li>
<li>The tool supports a no-code agent builder for quick development of
AI data agents and includes real-time data retrieval and automation
features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges Facing Enterprises</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2024 survey indicates that only 2% of US and UK businesses are
ready for production GenAI, highlighting issues in data infrastructure,
accessibility, latency, privacy, and security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications of RAG</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use cases in various sectors, such as telco customer service
chatbots, banking call center assistance, and HR applications,
demonstrate how RAG can improve user experiences and operational
efficiency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Resources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text promotes various reports and webinars that provide insights
into GenAI and RAG, encouraging businesses to explore how to optimize
their data for better AI functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
