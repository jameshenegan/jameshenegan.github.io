Key Concepts in Machine Learning - Inferencing, Predictions, and
Scoring</h1>
<p>Welcome to this tutorial on some foundational terms in the machine
learning lifecycle. This guide is structured to clarify each term’s
role, helping you understand how they fit together in building, testing,
and deploying a machine learning model.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-1-training-your-model">Step 1: Training Your Model</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-training">What is Training?</h3>
<p><strong>Training</strong> is the first step in creating a machine
learning model. Here, we feed the model a labeled dataset (where the
outcome is known), so it can learn patterns and relationships within the
data.</p>
<h3 id="goal-of-training">Goal of Training</h3>
<p>The goal is for the model to understand how input data relates to an
output label. For instance, in image classification, the model will
learn features in images that correspond to specific categories (e.g.,
“cat” vs. “dog”).</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Imagine a model that predicts house prices based on features like
square footage, location, and number of rooms. During training, the
model analyzes the historical data, finding relationships between house
features and their prices.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-2-model-evaluation">Step 2: Model Evaluation</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-evaluation">What is Evaluation?</h3>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> tests the model’s performance by
assessing how well it generalizes to data outside the training set. This
step usually involves a separate dataset, often called a
<em>validation</em> or <em>test set</em>, to simulate new, unseen
data.</p>
<h3 id="why-evaluation-matters">Why Evaluation Matters</h3>
<p>Model evaluation tells us whether the model is likely to perform well
on real-world data. Poor results indicate the model might be overfitting
(too specific to the training data) or underfitting (too
simplistic).</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>Continuing with our house price model, we might evaluate it on a
different set of houses to see if it accurately predicts their prices.
Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and mean
squared error (for regression).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-3-deploying-the-model-serving">Step 3: Deploying the Model
(Serving)</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-serving">What is Serving?</h3>
<p>Once you’re satisfied with the model’s performance,
<strong>serving</strong> is the process of making the model accessible
for real-time or batch predictions. This typically involves setting up
the model as a microservice or endpoint that can receive data and return
predictions.</p>
<h3 id="options-for-serving">Options for Serving</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-Device</strong>: Deploying the model on local devices
(e.g., mobile apps).</li>
<li><strong>On-Premises</strong>: Hosting within a controlled, local
environment.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-Based</strong>: Deploying on cloud infrastructure,
which is ideal for scalability and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-4-understanding-predictions">Step 4: Understanding
Predictions</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-prediction">What is a Prediction?</h3>
<p>Once the model is deployed, it can start generating
<strong>predictions</strong>—the process of using the model to analyze
new input data and produce an output.</p>
<p>There are two types of predictions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Online Prediction</strong>: Used for real-time predictions,
often when quick response times are needed. For example, an online
product recommendation system updates in real time as a user
browses.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Prediction</strong>: Used for generating predictions
on large datasets offline. This is ideal for cases like analyzing
customer data overnight to prepare recommendations for the next
day.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="when-to-use-prediction">When to Use Prediction</h3>
<p>Predictions can apply to different use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forecasting Future Outcomes</strong>: Predicting a value,
such as the likelihood of customer churn or the demand for a
product.</li>
<li><strong>Classification Tasks</strong>: Assigning labels, like
identifying spam emails or determining the sentiment of a text.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-5-inferencing">Step 5: Inferencing</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-inferencing">What is Inferencing?</h3>
<p>In <strong>inferencing</strong>, we use a trained model to generate
predictions from new data. While the term “prediction” is often used for
forecasting future values, <em>inferencing</em> can encompass broader
applications, such as image or text classification where we aren’t
predicting the future but are instead classifying or identifying
patterns in the data.</p>
<p>Inferencing is a term you’ll see a lot in production machine learning
systems, referring to using the model’s learned knowledge to process new
data.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example</h3>
<p>In an image classification system, inferencing might involve
analyzing a new image and determining that it contains a dog. This isn’t
a “prediction” in the temporal sense but rather a classification based
on the model’s learned understanding.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-6-scoring">Step 6: Scoring</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-scoring">What is Scoring?</h3>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong> is the process of applying the trained model
to data to produce a numerical score or classification. In some fields,
particularly in finance and marketing, scoring is commonly used to
assign a numeric value to a specific outcome.</p>
<h3 id="why-scoring-is-useful">Why Scoring is Useful</h3>
<p>Scoring often applies when predictions need to be in the form of a
score, risk level, or probability. This approach can be crucial for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: Assigning a credit risk score
based on financial history.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Segmentation</strong>: Scoring potential leads to
determine marketing priority.</li>
<li><strong>Ranking</strong>: Assigning relevance scores in
recommendation systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-3">Example</h3>
<p>A credit scoring model might analyze a customer’s financial data and
produce a risk score, indicating the likelihood they will repay a loan.
In this context, “scoring” emphasizes the generation of a specific,
actionable number.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Training</strong> → 2. <strong>Evaluation</strong> → 3.
<strong>Serving</strong> → 4.
<strong>Prediction/Inferencing/Scoring</strong>.</li>
