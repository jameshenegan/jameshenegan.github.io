Azure Machine Learning Studio</h1>
<h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>
<p><em>Suppose I want to use Azure DevOps and Azure Machine Learning
Studio. Let’s focus on a single “ML Project”. Suppose that a team has
two data scientists, three data analysts, and a manager. Suppose we want
two Azure Machine Learning workspaces. One will be a development
workspace and the other will be a production workspace. How many Azure
DevOps projects will we need? Just one? How many Azure Repos would we
need for the project? Just one? Can you expand on how the concept of
staging would work in this situation. Try to give as much detail as
possible. You see, I don’t think anyone on our team has worked with Git
on a team project before. And we’re having trouble understanding how and
when to incorporate Git. Our goal is to have gated approval when making
changes to the “Production” environment. But this is the first time
we’ve been trying to experiment with even having a production
environment. In the past, we’ve been working separately.</em></p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>For your team’s project setup with Azure DevOps and Azure Machine
Learning Studio, let’s break down each component in detail and look at
how staging, Git workflows, and gated approvals can help you manage your
development and production environments.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="recommended-setup">Recommended Setup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps Projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Azure DevOps Project</strong>: A single Azure DevOps
project can encompass both development and production workflows for the
ML project. Azure DevOps projects serve as a container for your
pipelines, repos, and artifacts, and one project can manage both
development and production environments.</li>
<li>Using a single project will simplify management, make resource
sharing easier, and reduce complexity in setting up pipelines, access
control, and approvals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Azure Repos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Azure Repo</strong>: A single repo within your Azure
DevOps project should be sufficient for managing the code, scripts,
configurations, and pipeline definitions for the project. This repo can
house all code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and
deployment.</li>
<li>Within this single repo, you’ll use <strong>branches</strong> to
separate and control different stages of development (e.g., development
branch and production branch).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-to-set-up-staging-and-environment-control">How to Set Up
Staging and Environment Control</h3>
<p>With your team structure and goal in mind, let’s outline the role of
Git branches and staging environments to control the flow of code and
ensure smooth collaboration between development and production.</p>
<h4 id="branching-strategy-in-azure-repos">1. <strong>Branching Strategy
in Azure Repos</strong></h4>
<p>Since Git is new to your team, a simple <strong>branching
strategy</strong> can help everyone collaborate without overwhelming
complexity. Here’s how it would work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Main Branches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development Branch</strong> (<code>dev</code>): Used for
active development and experimentation. The team (data scientists and
analysts) can push their latest changes here for testing and
iteration.</li>
<li><strong>Production Branch</strong> (<code>main</code> or
<code>prod</code>): Reserved for code and configurations that have
passed all tests and approvals. Only code that is ready for production
and deployment to the production Azure ML workspace goes here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature Branches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a team member starts working on a specific task (e.g., a new
preprocessing script or a model tuning effort), they create a
<strong>feature branch</strong> (e.g.,
<code>feature/experiment-tuning</code>). This branch is a copy of the
<code>dev</code> branch where they can make changes without affecting
others’ work.</li>
<li>Once work on a feature is complete, the feature branch is
<strong>merged back into the <code>dev</code> branch</strong> after
testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing and Approval for Production</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the <code>dev</code> branch that are ready for production
can be merged into the <code>main</code> or <code>prod</code> branch
after passing through approval gates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="setting-up-environments-and-approval-gates">2. <strong>Setting
Up Environments and Approval Gates</strong></h4>
<p>To manage the flow between development and production, use
<strong>two Azure Machine Learning workspaces</strong> as
environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development Environment</strong> (Dev Workspace):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used for experimentation, development, and
testing of new features or model configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: Data scientists and data analysts have full
access to experiment, train models, and modify resources in the Dev
workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: Set up an Azure DevOps pipeline that
triggers on changes to the <code>dev</code> branch. This pipeline will
push updated code to the Dev AML workspace and run end-to-end tests
(data processing, model training, and evaluation).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Production Environment</strong> (Prod Workspace):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used only for production-level models and
code that have passed all tests and approvals.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: Only approved code (from the
<code>main</code> or <code>prod</code> branch) is deployed here. Data
scientists and analysts have restricted access; the manager or a
specific DevOps engineer may control production deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline with Approval Gate</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set up an <strong>Azure DevOps release pipeline</strong> that
triggers on updates to the <code>main</code> or <code>prod</code>
branch.</li>
<li>This pipeline will include an <strong>approval gate</strong>: when
new code is merged into <code>main</code>, the manager or another
designated approver is notified to review and approve the changes before
deploying them to the Prod AML workspace.</li>
<li>After approval, the pipeline deploys the code to the Prod workspace,
ensuring a controlled release process.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="git-workflow-for-your-team">Git Workflow for Your Team</h3>
<p>Since your team is new to Git, here’s a detailed example of a
workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Feature Development</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data scientist or analyst creates a <strong>feature
branch</strong> from the <code>dev</code> branch to work on a specific
task (e.g., <code>feature/new-data-cleaning</code>).</li>
<li>They make changes, commit them frequently, and push these changes to
Azure Repos to save their progress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Review and Merge to Dev</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they complete the feature, they create a <strong>pull request
(PR)</strong> to merge their feature branch into the <code>dev</code>
branch.</li>
<li>Other team members or the manager can review the PR, provide
feedback, and approve the merge if the changes meet standards.</li>
<li>After the merge, the changes are now part of the <code>dev</code>
branch and accessible to the entire team for further integration and
testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing in Development Environment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DevOps pipeline triggers on changes to the <code>dev</code>
branch, automatically deploying the latest version to the Dev AML
workspace.</li>
<li>In this workspace, models are trained, tested, and evaluated by data
scientists and analysts. This ensures all components function correctly
before moving to production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Approval for Production</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changes in <code>dev</code> are stable and validated, they are
merged into the <code>main</code> or <code>prod</code> branch through
another PR.</li>
<li>This triggers the <strong>production pipeline</strong> in Azure
DevOps, which pauses at an <strong>approval gate</strong>. The manager
reviews the changes to ensure they’re ready for production.</li>
<li>Upon approval, the pipeline deploys the code to the Prod AML
workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-workflow">Summary Workflow</h3>
<p>Here’s an overview of the workflow your team would follow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Develop</strong>: Team members work on feature branches,
merge into <code>dev</code> after review, and run tests in the Dev
workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Validate</strong>: Once features in <code>dev</code> are
confirmed to be stable, they are merged into the <code>main</code>
branch.</li>
<li><strong>Approve and Deploy</strong>: The manager approves changes
via an approval gate in Azure DevOps, which deploys the final version to
the Prod AML workspace.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-benefits-of-this-setup">Key Benefits of This Setup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Controlled Development and Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having separate development and production workspaces allows for
experimentation in Dev without affecting Prod.</li>
<li>Approval gates ensure that only vetted and approved changes reach
production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Collaboration with Git</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature branches provide isolated workspaces for each team member,
while the main branches (<code>dev</code> and <code>main/prod</code>)
centralize stable versions.</li>
<li>Git history and pull requests in Azure Repos keep a detailed record
of changes, enabling easier tracking and collaboration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency and Reproducibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By keeping code and configurations versioned in Git and running them
in controlled environments, your team achieves a reproducible
workflow.</li>
<li>Azure DevOps pipelines automate repetitive tasks, ensuring
consistency across deployments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced Risk with Staging and Approval
Gates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The staging process in Dev, followed by manager approvals, minimizes
the risk of deploying untested or unstable code to production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This setup provides structure and security for the ML lifecycle,
helping your team smoothly transition from solo experimentation to
collaborative, production-ready ML development.</p>
<h2 id="question-2">Question 2</h2>
<p><em>Can you explain why we need two Azure Machine Learning
workspaces? It is what some Microsoft Learn training recommended. They
said it would be possible to just use one, but it would be better to use
two so that only certain people have certain access to things</em></p>
<h2 id="response-1">Response</h2>
<p>Using <strong>two Azure Machine Learning (AML)
workspaces</strong>—one for development and one for production—is a best
practice recommended for several important reasons, particularly around
<strong>access control</strong>, <strong>data segregation</strong>,
<strong>workflow management</strong>, and <strong>security</strong>.
Here’s a breakdown of why this approach is beneficial, especially for a
team setup like yours:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="access-control-and-permissions">1. <strong>Access Control and
Permissions</strong></h3>
<p>When you have two separate AML workspaces, you can implement more
precise access control policies to ensure that team members only have
access to what they need in each environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development Workspace</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This environment is more flexible, where data scientists, data
analysts, and other contributors have broader permissions.</li>
<li>The development workspace allows for full experimentation, where
team members can test different models, perform feature engineering, and
modify compute resources without risk to production workloads.</li>
<li>Since this workspace is designed for experimentation, it’s usually
more open, and access is granted to all team members who are actively
involved in the ML project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Production Workspace</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This environment is more tightly controlled, with access limited to
certain users, such as the manager or designated machine learning
engineers.</li>
<li>Restricting access in production ensures that only approved, final
versions of models, scripts, and pipelines are deployed, reducing the
risk of accidental modifications that could impact production services
or sensitive data.</li>
<li>Using <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> in Azure,
you can assign roles that limit permissions (e.g., some users can only
view logs or monitor model performance but cannot modify models or
pipelines in production).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Two Workspaces?</strong> Having two workspaces allows for
a clear separation of duties. It’s possible to restrict production
access for team members who do not need it, reducing potential errors
and providing tighter security for production data and models.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="data-segregation-and-compliance">2. <strong>Data Segregation and
Compliance</strong></h3>
<p>Different datasets may be used across development and production
environments, especially when working with sensitive data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This might include sample data, anonymized data, or a subset of
production data, allowing the team to explore, clean, and experiment
without exposing full datasets.</li>
<li>Using a separate workspace for development ensures that sensitive or
regulated data isn’t accessed unnecessarily, helping to maintain data
privacy and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Production Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This environment typically works with live or near-live production
data, ensuring that model performance aligns with real-world
scenarios.</li>
<li>Production data should be safeguarded and managed with stricter
permissions, with limited access granted only to team members directly
responsible for production model oversight.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Two Workspaces?</strong> Separating data into two
environments minimizes the risk of unintentional data exposure or
misuse. It ensures that development work does not interfere with
production datasets, aligning with data governance and compliance
requirements.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="separate-development-and-deployment-workflows">3.
<strong>Separate Development and Deployment Workflows</strong></h3>
<p>Having two AML workspaces enables your team to establish separate
workflows, making it easier to manage the ML lifecycle stages, including
development, testing, and deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The development workspace supports iterative model training,
experimentation, and validation.</li>
<li>Data scientists can try different feature engineering techniques,
experiment with hyperparameters, and compare multiple model versions
without impacting production.</li>
<li>The development environment allows quick experimentation without the
risk of affecting the production pipeline.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Production Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The production workspace is designed for final, tested versions of
models that are ready for deployment.</li>
<li>Models and scripts that pass development and testing stages are
deployed here through controlled, automated pipelines.</li>
<li>You can set up <strong>Azure DevOps approval gates</strong> for code
going from the development to production environment, ensuring rigorous
checks before deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Two Workspaces?</strong> Using two workspaces creates a
structured workflow that isolates experimentation from production. This
separation allows production models to be deployed and monitored without
interference from ongoing development.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="enhanced-security-and-stability-in-production">4.
<strong>Enhanced Security and Stability in Production</strong></h3>
<p>Separating development and production environments is a critical
security practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Minimized Risk of Errors in Production</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers and analysts working in the development workspace are
less likely to make accidental changes to production models or
resources.</li>
<li>Production models and pipelines are secured, preventing unintended
alterations that could disrupt business processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Controlled Deployment with Gated Approvals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using Azure DevOps pipelines with gated approvals, you can
enforce a process where only approved code and models are promoted to
production.</li>
<li>The manager or an authorized engineer can review any changes before
they’re deployed in the production workspace, ensuring stability and
reliability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Two Workspaces?</strong> Separating environments
minimizes the risk of accidental changes to production and ensures that
only stable, approved versions of models are deployed, leading to
greater stability and security in production.</p>

<p>In summary, using two Azure Machine Learning workspaces allows your
team to create a controlled, efficient, and secure workflow that aligns
with best practices for model development and deployment. While it’s
technically possible to use a single workspace, separating development
and production environments brings several key advantages in access
control, data handling, workflow management, and security.</p>
<h2 id="question-3">Question 3</h2>
<p><em>Another thing that I’m having a hard time understanding is “What
happens in Azure Machine Learning Studio” and “What happens in Azure
DevOps”. You see, I’ve spent some time working in AML Studio and I feel
like I have a pretty good understanding of how it works. But I just
heard about Azure DevOps recently and I’m not quite sure I understand
where the code gets executed. One thing that’s confusing to me is that
some of the terms that got used in AML Studio (pipeline, environment)
also get used in Azure DevOps, but they mean different things in DevOps.
I would like you to address this general confusion I have. But here is a
specific phrase that triggered my question: “Set up an Azure DevOps
pipeline that triggers on changes to the dev branch. This pipeline will
push updated code to the Dev AML workspace and run end-to-end tests
(data processing, model training, and evaluation).” My question is:
consider the code that runs end-to-end tests? Where does this code get
run? In a Docker container associated with Azure DevOps? Or does it get
run on the compute resources of AML studio? It’s this sort of thing that
I’m confused by</em></p>
<h2 id="response-2">Response</h2>
<p>It’s understandable to feel a bit confused because <strong>Azure
Machine Learning Studio (AML Studio)</strong> and <strong>Azure
DevOps</strong> have some overlapping concepts (like “pipelines” and
“environments”) but are designed for different purposes and work
together in distinct ways. Let’s break down what happens in each
platform, how they interact, and where different parts of the code
actually run.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="high-level-overview-of-each-platform">High-Level Overview of
Each Platform</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Azure Machine Learning Studio (AML Studio)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: AML Studio is designed specifically for
machine learning workflows. It’s where data scientists and analysts work
on data processing, model training, experimentation, and
deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Core Activities in AML Studio</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Create and manage datasets, notebooks, and scripts.</li>
<li>Train models using various compute resources (e.g., CPU, GPU, or
Azure ML compute clusters).</li>
<li>Build and manage machine learning pipelines for end-to-end workflows
(e.g., data preprocessing, model training, evaluation).</li>
<li>Deploy models to production endpoints (e.g., real-time or batch

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Azure DevOps is a broader platform focused

</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-azure-devops-and-aml-studio-work-together">How Azure DevOps
and AML Studio Work Together</h3>
<p>In a machine learning project, <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> acts as
the overarching control system, managing the code lifecycle, automation,
and deployment pipelines, while <strong>AML Studio</strong> focuses on
the ML-specific tasks, like data processing and model training, using
dedicated compute resources.</p>
<p>Here’s how they work together step-by-step, including where code is
executed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Code Management with Azure Repos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All scripts, notebooks, and pipeline definitions are stored in
<strong>Azure Repos</strong> in the form of a Git repository.</li>
<li>This repository is the single source of truth, so any updates to
data processing scripts, model code, or pipeline configurations are
managed here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pipeline Execution in Azure DevOps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Azure DevOps Pipelines</strong>, you set up workflows to
automate tasks such as running tests, training models, and deploying
models.</li>
<li>Azure DevOps Pipelines <strong>trigger</strong> on events like code
changes (e.g., updates to the <code>dev</code> branch). However, DevOps
pipelines don’t run the ML code directly on their own compute resources;
they <strong>orchestrate</strong> the workflow and direct execution to
the appropriate environment, in this case, AML Studio.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Triggering ML Workflows in AML Studio</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Azure DevOps pipeline is triggered, it sends commands to
AML Studio to start executing the ML pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: When you run end-to-end tests, the code
for data processing, model training, and evaluation is run on
<strong>AML Studio compute resources</strong> (e.g., Azure ML clusters
or VMs configured in AML Studio).</li>
<li><strong>Connection to AML Studio</strong>: DevOps can initiate
workflows in AML Studio through the Azure CLI, specifically using
commands like <code>az ml job create</code> in a DevOps pipeline step to
launch a predefined AML pipeline. This command instructs AML Studio to
execute the specified ML job using the compute resources in AML.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Compute Resources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AML Studio Compute</strong>: All heavy ML tasks—data
processing, model training, and evaluation—are executed on the compute
resources managed in AML Studio (e.g., AML Compute Clusters, Azure VMs).
These resources are configured directly in AML Studio, where you can
monitor usage, scale resources, and view experiment results.</li>
<li><strong>Azure DevOps Agents</strong>: The DevOps pipeline itself
runs on an <strong>Azure DevOps agent</strong>, which is typically a
lightweight VM (e.g., Ubuntu or Windows). The agent’s role is to execute
pipeline steps like checking out the code, installing necessary
dependencies, and using CLI commands to trigger AML Studio workflows.
However, it does not perform the actual ML training or processing.</li>

<li><p><strong>Triggering AML Studio to Run ML Code</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the DevOps pipeline, there is a step where it uses the
<code>az ml job create</code> command (through the Azure CLI).</li>
<li>This command <strong>sends an instruction to AML Studio to start
running a specific pipeline</strong> (e.g., a training pipeline defined
in <code>pipeline-job.yml</code>) on the Dev workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Location</strong>: The actual data processing,
model training, and evaluation are done on AML Studio’s compute
resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>AML Studio Pipeline Execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AML Studio pipeline runs its ML-specific steps:
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Runs on AML compute resources
(e.g., a CPU cluster).</li>
<li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Uses configured AML Studio
resources, such as a GPU cluster if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Runs on AML compute and logs metrics to
the AML Studio workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The pipeline’s results (metrics, logs, and models) are saved within
AML Studio, allowing for review and validation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Approval Gates and Production Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once testing is complete in the development environment, the DevOps
pipeline may have a manual <strong>approval gate</strong> for deploying
to production.</li>
<li>After approval, a separate command can trigger a <strong>production
AML pipeline</strong> that deploys the tested model to production
compute resources within the Prod AML workspace.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Azure DevOps</strong> orchestrates the flow, triggers the ML
pipeline, and manages CI/CD, but <strong>does not execute ML
training</strong>. Instead, it calls AML Studio to handle those
tasks.</li>
<li><strong>AML Studio</strong> is where ML-specific tasks occur, using
its own compute resources (AML clusters, VMs) to run data processing,
training, and evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>DevOps Pipelines</strong> control the overall workflow,
while <strong>AML Studio Pipelines</strong> execute the ML steps. These
two pipeline types work together, with Azure DevOps initiating AML
Studio’s ML workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Terminology</strong> differs:
<ul>
<li><strong>DevOps Environments</strong> control deployment stages (dev,
staging, prod) and manage approvals.</li>
<li><strong>AML Environments</strong> define software and package
configurations needed for ML tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This separation of responsibilities allows each tool to focus on its
strengths, with Azure DevOps managing code, approvals, and CI/CD, and
AML Studio providing a specialized environment for machine learning.</p>
<h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
<p><em>when i merge the development branch into the production branch,
does the development branch disappear</em></p>
<h2 id="response-3">Response</h2>
<p>Yes, <strong>feature branches</strong> are typically
<strong>temporary</strong> and are meant to disappear after their work
is complete. Here’s how feature branches generally work in a
collaborative workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Creating a Feature Branch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a team member starts working on a new task (e.g., a
preprocessing update, model tuning, or feature addition), they create a
<strong>feature branch</strong> off the <code>dev</code> branch.</li>
<li>This branch is usually named to describe the work being done, like
<code>feature/data-cleaning-improvement</code> or
<code>feature/model-tuning-v2</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Working on the Feature Branch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The team member makes all necessary changes, commits frequently, and
tests the work within this feature branch without affecting the main
<code>dev</code> branch.</li>
<li>The feature branch isolates the work, allowing team members to
experiment or work independently without impacting the stability of
<code>dev</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Merging the Feature Branch Back into
<code>dev</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the work in the feature branch is complete and passes any
required tests or reviews, the feature branch is <strong>merged back
into the <code>dev</code> branch</strong>.</li>
<li>This brings the changes into the main development workflow.</li>
<li>The merge process might involve a <strong>pull request (PR)</strong>
to enable code review and approvals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Deleting the Feature Branch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After merging into <code>dev</code>, the feature branch has served
its purpose, so it’s typically <strong>deleted</strong> to keep the
repository clean and organized.</li>
<li>Deleting the feature branch does not affect the code, as all its
changes are now integrated into <code>dev</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-feature-branches-are-deleted">Why Feature Branches Are
Deleted</h3>
<p>Feature branches are short-lived by design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose Fulfillment</strong>: Once their specific feature or
fix has been integrated into <code>dev</code>, they’re no longer
needed.</li>
<li><strong>Repository Cleanliness</strong>: Removing completed feature
branches prevents the repository from becoming cluttered with obsolete
branches.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking Progress</strong>: By only keeping active branches
(like <code>dev</code> and <code>main</code>) and relevant in-progress
feature branches, the team can easily see what work is currently
ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature branches are temporary</strong>: They exist only for
the duration of the specific task or feature they were created for.</li>
<li><strong>Deleted after merging</strong>: Once the feature branch is
merged into <code>dev</code>, it’s typically deleted, as its work is now
integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Isolated development</strong>: Feature branches allow team
members to work independently and safely, contributing to the main
codebase once ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow keeps the main branches (like <code>dev</code> and
<code>main</code>) clean, organized, and stable while supporting
structured, collaborative development.</p>
<h2 id="question-5">Question 5</h2>
<p><em>what is a pull request. can you explain where a pull request
would occur if i have a main branch (prod), a dev branch, and a feature
branch</em></p>
<h2 id="response-4">Response</h2>
<p>A <strong>pull request (PR)</strong> is a request to merge changes
from one branch into another, typically after code review and testing.
In the context of your project, where you have a <code>main</code>
(prod) branch, a <code>dev</code> branch, and multiple
<code>feature</code> branches, pull requests are essential for
coordinating and reviewing changes before they move between
branches.</p>
<h3 id="how-pull-requests-work">How Pull Requests Work</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Purpose of a Pull Request</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pull request serves as a <strong>collaboration tool</strong>. It
allows team members to review code changes, discuss them, and ensure
they meet quality standards before merging.</li>
<li>It also provides an opportunity to <strong>run automated
tests</strong> (like linting or unit tests) to catch issues early.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a Pull Request</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a team member finishes work on a <strong>feature
branch</strong>, they create a pull request to merge their changes into
the <strong>dev branch</strong>.</li>
<li>This PR opens a discussion forum where team members can review code,
suggest changes, and approve or request modifications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Approval Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Azure DevOps (or any Git-based system), reviewers can add
comments, request changes, or approve the PR.</li>
<li>Once reviewers approve the pull request and all tests pass, the code
can be merged into the target branch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="where-pull-requests-would-occur-in-your-workflow">Where Pull
Requests Would Occur in Your Workflow</h3>
<p>With a <code>main</code> (prod) branch, a <code>dev</code> branch,
and feature branches, pull requests would typically happen in two main
scenarios:</p>
<h4 id="feature-branch-to-dev-branch-development-stage">1.
<strong>Feature Branch to Dev Branch</strong> (Development Stage)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: A team member creates a <strong>feature
branch</strong> from <code>dev</code> to work on a specific task or
feature.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: After completing the task, they create a
<strong>pull request to merge the feature branch into the dev
branch</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Review and Approval</strong>: The pull request goes through
a review process. Other team members can check the code, comment on any
issues, or approve it if the feature is ready to be integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Merge and Delete</strong>: Once approved, the feature branch
is merged into <code>dev</code>. The feature branch is often deleted
afterward since its work has been incorporated into
<code>dev</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Pull Request?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This PR is primarily for code quality control, allowing the team to
review and discuss changes before they affect the broader development
branch.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dev-branch-to-main-branch-production-stage">2. <strong>Dev
Branch to Main Branch</strong> (Production Stage)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once enough tested and stable features have
accumulated in the <code>dev</code> branch, the team decides to promote
these changes to the <code>main</code> branch for production.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: A <strong>pull request is created to merge
<code>dev</code> into <code>main</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Testing and Approval</strong>: This pull request usually
includes more rigorous review and testing, as the changes are intended
for production. Additional <strong>approval gates</strong> may be
required here, especially from managers or senior engineers.</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong>: After passing all reviews and tests, the
changes in <code>dev</code> are merged into <code>main</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Once merged into <code>main</code>, the
code is ready for deployment in the production environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Pull Request?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This PR is critical for ensuring that only approved, tested code is
deployed to production. It provides an extra layer of oversight and
security before changes impact end users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pull-request-workflow-example">Pull Request Workflow
Example</h3>
<p>Let’s visualize a typical workflow using pull requests:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Create a Feature Branch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A team member starts a feature branch (e.g.,
<code>feature/new-data-cleaning</code>) from <code>dev</code> to work on
a new data preprocessing feature.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pull Request to Merge Feature into Dev</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After completing work on the feature branch, the team member opens a
<strong>pull request to merge <code>feature/new-data-cleaning</code>
into <code>dev</code></strong>.</li>
<li>Other team members review the PR, add comments, and approve it if
the code is satisfactory.</li>
<li>The feature branch is merged into <code>dev</code>, and the feature
branch is optionally deleted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pull Request to Merge Dev into Main</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After enough features have been merged and tested in
<code>dev</code>, the team opens a <strong>pull request to merge
<code>dev</code> into <code>main</code></strong>.</li>
<li>This pull request may have additional checks, such as automated
tests and approval gates, ensuring that only stable and approved code
reaches production.</li>
<li>Once approved, the <code>dev</code> branch changes are merged into
<code>main</code>, and the new features are ready for production
deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature Branch to Dev</strong>: Use pull requests here for
code review, collaboration, and quality control within the development
team.</li>
<li><strong>Dev to Main</strong>: Use pull requests with added approvals
and tests before deploying code to production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pull requests provide transparency, improve code quality, and
facilitate collaboration, helping your team maintain a stable and secure
codebase across development and production environments.</p>
<h2 id="question-6">Question 6</h2>
<p><em>Would the production branch be accessing and working with the
“production” AML workspace while the development branch would be
accessing and working with the “development” AML workspace?</em></p>
<h2 id="response-5">Response</h2>
<p>Yes, that’s exactly correct! In this setup, the <strong>production
branch</strong> (<code>main</code> or <code>prod</code>) would connect
to the <strong>production AML workspace</strong>, while the
<strong>development branch</strong> (<code>dev</code>) would work with
the <strong>development AML workspace</strong>. This separation is a
best practice for ensuring that production resources are only used with
stable, approved code and to isolate experimental and development
activities from production operations.</p>
<p>Here’s how this setup would work in detail:</p>
<h3 id="development-branch-and-development-aml-workspace">Development
Branch and Development AML Workspace</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Branch</strong>: The <code>dev</code> branch in Azure
Repos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workspace</strong>: The <strong>development AML
workspace</strong> in Azure Machine Learning Studio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When team members commit code changes to the <code>dev</code> branch
(e.g., updated preprocessing steps, new model configurations, or feature
engineering), these changes can trigger pipelines in <strong>Azure
DevOps</strong> that interact with the development AML workspace.</li>
<li>This workspace is used for experimentation, model tuning, and
testing. It allows data scientists and analysts to iterate freely
without risk to production resources.</li>
<li><strong>Compute Resources</strong>: The development AML workspace is
configured with its own set of compute resources, so any training, data
processing, or evaluations done in <code>dev</code> remain isolated from
production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The development workspace allows for flexible and unrestricted
testing, where team members can try new ideas without impacting
production.</li>
<li>It minimizes the risk of introducing bugs or untested features into
the production environment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Usage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once changes in the <code>dev</code> branch are thoroughly tested
and approved, they are merged into the <code>main</code> or
<code>prod</code> branch. This merge is typically gated by an approval
process, which could include code reviews, automated testing, and
manager approval.</li>
<li>After merging into <code>main</code>, Azure DevOps pipelines can
trigger workflows that deploy models, data processing pipelines, or
inference endpoints to the production AML workspace.</li>
<li>The production AML workspace is configured with
<strong>production-grade compute resources</strong> and data connections
necessary to serve models in a live environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only stable, vetted code from the <code>main</code> branch is
deployed to production, reducing the likelihood of issues.</li>
<li>Any accidental or experimental changes in development remain safely

</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-this-separation-works-in-practice">How This Separation Works
in Practice</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Configuration in DevOps Pipelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development Pipeline</strong>: The Azure DevOps pipeline for
<code>dev</code> is configured to use <strong>service
connections</strong> that point to the <strong>development AML
workspace</strong>. This means that any jobs or commands run in this
pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing, model training) will execute in the
development workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Production Pipeline</strong>: The pipeline for
<code>main</code> is configured to use service connections that point to
the <strong>production AML workspace</strong>. When jobs are triggered
here, they deploy models or run processes in the production
environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment Variables and Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the DevOps pipeline configuration, use <strong>environment
variables</strong> or <strong>parameters</strong> to specify the
workspace and compute targets.</li>
<li>For example, you can specify
<code>AML_WORKSPACE_NAME=dev-workspace</code> for the development
pipeline and <code>AML_WORKSPACE_NAME=prod-workspace</code> for the
production pipeline. This ensures that each pipeline knows which AML
workspace to connect to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Approval Gates in Production Pipeline</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the <code>dev</code> branch is ready to be merged into
<code>main</code>, a <strong>pull request (PR)</strong> is created.</li>
<li>This PR requires <strong>approvals</strong> (e.g., from a manager or

<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>In summary, the <strong>development branch</strong> connects to the
<strong>development AML workspace</strong>, while the <strong>production
branch</strong> connects to the <strong>production AML
workspace</strong>. This setup maintains clear boundaries, supporting
safe experimentation in development and robust, controlled deployments
in production. By managing this separation in Azure DevOps with
appropriate environment configurations, variables, and approvals, you
can streamline the workflow and safeguard your production environment
effectively.</p>
<h2 id="question-7">Question 7</h2>
<p><em>Okay, I guess I’m getting confused on whether or note the concept
of approval gates are related to the various branches (prod, dev,
feature) of a repository, or if they are related to the various
environments of an azure devops repository — or perhaps both</em></p>
<h2 id="response-6">Response</h2>
<p>It’s understandable that this can be confusing because approval gates
can indeed be applied in different contexts within Azure DevOps. Let’s
clarify how approval gates relate to both branches and environments and
how they interact in typical workflows:</p>
<h3 id="approval-gates-in-branches">1. <strong>Approval Gates in
Branches</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch-based Approval Gates</strong> (also called branch
policies) are set up directly on branches within your repository (such
as <code>dev</code>, <code>feature</code>, or <code>main/prod</code>).
These policies determine who can approve pull requests (PRs), the
required number of approvals, mandatory reviewers, and other conditions
that must be met before merging code.</li>
<li>For instance, in a trunk-based development setup, you might set
approval gates on the <code>main</code> or <code>trunk</code> branch to
ensure that only tested and approved code gets merged. In a more
branching-heavy strategy (like Git Flow), you could have gates on the
<code>dev</code> branch to control the flow of code from feature
branches to the main development line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approval-gates-in-environments">2. <strong>Approval Gates in
Environments</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment-based Approval Gates</strong> are part of
deployment pipelines in Azure DevOps, and they help control when and how
code is deployed to different environments (like Development, QA,
Staging, or Production).</li>
<li>In this context, approval gates are applied at specific stages in
the release pipeline rather than directly on code branches. For example,
after code is merged into the main branch, a pipeline may automatically
build and deploy it to a <code>Dev</code> environment. Approval gates
can then be configured to require manual approval before proceeding to
higher environments (e.g., <code>QA</code> or <code>Prod</code>).</li>
<li>These gates are helpful for teams that want additional validation
before deploying to sensitive environments, adding a layer of security
and oversight over the deployment process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-these-work-together">How These Work Together:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch Policies for Code Quality</strong>: Branch-based
approval gates focus on ensuring that only validated code gets merged
into critical branches.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Approval Gates for Deployment Control</strong>:
Environment-based approval gates focus on controlling deployment flows,
ensuring that code only reaches certain environments once it’s
approved.</li>
<li>It’s common to use both: You may have gated approvals on branches
(e.g., to merge to <code>main</code>) and gated deployment approvals
before moving code to a production environment. This setup offers
control over both code quality and the release process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-scenario">Example Scenario</h3>
<p>Imagine you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>main</code> branch protected by branch-based approval
gates.</li>
<li>A deployment pipeline that deploys code to <code>Dev</code>,
<code>Staging</code>, and <code>Production</code> environments, with
environment-based approval gates before <code>Staging</code> and
<code>Production</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>branch-based gates</strong> would require code review and
approvals before merging to <code>main</code>, while the
<strong>environment-based gates</strong> would require approval before
promoting the code to production, even after it’s merged to
<code>main</code>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch approval gates</strong> ensure code quality and
compliance before merging.</li>
<li><strong>Environment approval gates</strong> control and secure the
deployment process across environments.</li>
</ul>
