  <body><p>It can be inspiring—and deeply motivating—to view the act of writing
anything, even “dry” company documentation, in the larger context of
truth, integrity, and service. If you want to bring a sense of reverence
to your documentation, consider these perspectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Documentation as an Extension of
Truth-Telling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the spirit of Jordan Peterson’s emphasis on not lying—or speaking
with integrity in <em>The Four Agreements</em>—you can treat your
documentation as a site where clarity and honesty truly matter.</li>
<li>Every sentence in your documentation becomes an exercise in saying
exactly what you mean. Instead of padding the text with jargon or
uncertain statements, aim for precision. This doesn’t just improve the
doc’s quality; it also cultivates your own habit of careful
truth-telling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Connecting to the Larger “Logos”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Historically, writing was a laborious act. People wrote on papyrus
scrolls, clay tablets, or by carving letters into stone. The very
<em>effort</em> involved meant they did not record what was
trivial.</li>
<li>Even though we now have the luxury of typing in a word processor (or
even dictating into a phone), you can choose to approach documentation
with that same mindfulness. Do a mental check: “If I had to chisel this
into stone, would I still include it?”</li>
<li>This practice will push you to prioritize what’s most essential and
communicate it effectively, treating your words as an extension of the
sacred tradition of “putting truth into text.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Service and Empathy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One reason religious or philosophical texts feel “important” is that
they aim to serve humanity at large—to teach, to guide, to heal.</li>
<li>Documentation is also a form of service: it helps colleagues, new
hires, or even future versions of yourself. In a sense, you’re teaching
and guiding, ensuring that knowledge isn’t lost or misunderstood.</li>
<li>If you approach your writing as an act of service—like a teacher
creating a clear textbook—it becomes more than a chore. It becomes a
meaningful contribution to the collective knowledge base of your
team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality Over Quantity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our time is flooded with text—emails, social media posts, memos.
Because it’s so easy to write, we can forget the importance of
thoughtful composition.</li>
<li>Adopting a mindset of deliberate creation helps ensure you’re
producing something of lasting value. Ask yourself: “What’s the <em>most
concise</em> but <em>most accurate</em> way to convey this information?”
This not only reduces clutter, but also demonstrates respect for your
readers’ time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Craftsmanship and Pride</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of your documentation as craftsmanship. Even if it isn’t
destined for the public realm like a best-selling philosophy book, you
can still have pride in your craft.</li>
<li>Pay attention to structure, clarity, and style. A well-crafted piece
of documentation—logical headings, clear examples, coherent
flow—elevates the text from “just another file” to something that people
turn to as an authoritative, user-friendly reference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Longevity and Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It might not be the Bible or Plato’s dialogues, but your
documentation could be used or referenced for years to come, long after
you’ve moved on from that role.</li>
<li>Think about a future person who might rely on your words to solve a
critical problem or avoid a major pitfall. In that sense, there’s a real
“historical” quality to even the simplest documentation.</li>
<li>Taking care in your writing is a way of showing respect to those
future readers. You are, in a small but meaningful way, shaping the
future of your organization’s knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Staying Grounded in Purpose</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can hold both truths at once: your documentation might not save
mankind, but it certainly can make life and work easier for those around
you.</li>
<li>That alone is a purpose worth respecting. If you see documentation
as a form of stewardship—helping preserve and transmit what’s
valuable—you can imbue it with the spirit of doing good work for the
benefit of others.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3
id="practical-tips-to-bring-this-perspective-into-your-writing">Practical
Tips to Bring This Perspective into Your Writing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outline with Intention</strong>: Before writing, outline
your topics and ask, “Why is each piece of information important? What
question does it answer?” This keeps you from adding superfluous
text.</li>
<li><strong>Use Clear Language</strong>: Strive for clarity and
precision. Eliminate unnecessary jargon. If you had to read your own
documentation in a hurry under stress, would it be easy to
understand?</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate Examples</strong>: Well-chosen examples help
readers internalize information. This is reminiscent of parables or
stories in ancient texts—it shows, rather than tells.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate</strong>: Like any craft, good writing benefits from
revision. Draft, step away, and come back with fresh eyes to see if
every sentence is necessary, honest, and clear.</li>
<li><strong>Invite Feedback</strong>: Documentation is a living text
that serves others. Ask peers for feedback, just as teachers and
philosophers relied on dialogue. This helps refine and ensure your words
serve the intended purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, you can honor the “power of the word” by creating
documentation that is accurate, thoughtful, and genuinely useful. You
may not be shaping Western philosophy, but you <em>are</em> providing
knowledge, clarity, and continuity within your company—and that is a
worthy undertaking in its own right. By treating your words with care
and aligning your writing with a spirit of integrity and service, you’ll
elevate even seemingly mundane tasks into something more meaningful and
enduring.</p>
