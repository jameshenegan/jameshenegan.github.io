<p><strong>A Tutorial on Understanding and Managing “Documentation”
Across Multiple Teams</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial provides an overview of how “documentation” can be
interpreted differently within an organization and offers strategies for
managing documentation efforts across varied teams—especially when
there’s an auditing or compliance requirement in play.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="background-why-documentation-matters-for-auditing">1.
Background: Why Documentation Matters for Auditing</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Accounting Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When an IT department builds software or other technology
“in-house,” that work may be treated as an asset on the company’s
books.</li>
<li>Accounting needs evidence that the intangible asset genuinely exists
and that resources were appropriately allocated to create it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Auditing Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Auditors verify that the work claimed to have been done (which may
be capitalized) has indeed been completed.</li>
<li>Tools like Azure DevOps Boards store tasks, user stories, sprints,
and other records showing how and when work was completed.</li>
<li>This “paper trail” is critical: it provides proof of the tasks done,
the code changes, and the testing completed—essentially confirming that
the intangible asset truly exists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="recognizing-different-types-of-documentation">2. Recognizing
Different Types of Documentation</h2>
<p>The term “documentation” can be confusing because it’s used in
multiple ways for multiple audiences. Common documentation categories
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Technical/Developer Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Written by developers for developers.</li>
<li>Explains code structure, design decisions, APIs, how modules
integrate, etc.</li>
<li>Main goal: Make future maintenance and extensions easier.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>User Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Created for end users or business stakeholders who need to operate
or consume a product.</li>
<li>May include step-by-step instructions, FAQs, screenshots of
workflows, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Process/Project Documentation</strong> (e.g., Azure
DevOps Boards)</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents how tasks, user stories, or product increments are planned
and completed.</li>
<li>Useful for project managers, auditors, or anyone needing an overview
of the work’s progress and sign-offs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit/Compliance Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically addresses regulatory and audit needs.</li>
<li>Focuses on proving that proper controls, processes, and sign-offs
were followed.</li>
<li>Demonstrates compliance with internal or external standards.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the organization and the project, these types of
documentation may overlap or even be combined. However, each typically
serves a distinct audience or purpose.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="real-world-scenario-four-different-teams-four-different-documentation-needs">3.
Real-World Scenario: Four Different Teams, Four Different Documentation
Needs</h2>
<p>Imagine a department with four teams:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Governance</strong> – Creates data policies, standards,
and compliance guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analytics</strong> – Works on statistical or
machine-learning models, advanced analytics, or data-driven
insights.</li>
<li><strong>Data Engineering</strong> – Builds and maintains data
pipelines, ingestion processes, ETL/ELT frameworks, and often handles
data infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Business Intelligence (BI)</strong> – Creates dashboards,
visualizations, and reports (e.g., in Power BI).</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these teams requires documentation, but the form and content
of that documentation can vary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Governance Documentation</strong> might be policy
manuals, frameworks for handling data quality and compliance, or records
of data usage and retention policies.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analytics Documentation</strong> might describe
methodologies for models, data sources used, code snippets for
reproducible research, or Jupyter notebooks.</li>
<li><strong>Data Engineering Documentation</strong> might detail
pipeline architectures, code for ETL processes, infrastructure diagrams,
or DevOps pipeline logs.</li>
<li><strong>BI Documentation</strong> might include user guides for
dashboards, instructions on how to refresh or maintain the reports, and
the logic behind KPIs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="challenges-lack-of-manager-involvement-standardization">4.
Challenges: Lack of Manager Involvement &amp; Standardization</h2>
<p>When you are tasked with creating a “documentation strategy” for the
entire department, you can face issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Teams, Different Needs</strong><br />
The diverse nature of the teams makes it tricky to create a single,
one-size-fits-all approach.</li>
<li><strong>No Managerial Sponsorship</strong><br />
Without leadership support, it can be hard to mandate consistent
documentation practices.</li>
<li><strong>Unclear Ownership</strong><br />
It’s often unclear who is accountable for ensuring that documentation is
maintained and meets the required standards.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="practical-strategies-to-move-forward">5. Practical Strategies to
Move Forward</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Seek Management Buy-In</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Present a concise summary of the benefits and risks:
<ul>
<li><em>Benefits:</em> easier onboarding, reduced maintenance time,
clearer audit trails.</li>
<li><em>Risks of doing nothing:</em> unverified work, inconsistent
processes, difficulty passing audits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even a short manager-approved plan can bolster cooperation across
teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Set Minimal, Common Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify a few “universal” standards (e.g., a shared repository,
basic versioning rules, naming conventions).</li>
<li>Don’t over-prescribe. Let each team add specialized sections or
details they need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a Standard Template with Space for
Customization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Include basic fields like <em>Title, Owner, Revision Date, Purpose,
and Dependencies.</em></li>
<li>Encourage each team to add sections relevant to their deliverables
(e.g., policy vs. code docs vs. dashboards).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Involve Key Representatives from Each Team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If direct managers aren’t available, aim to get input from senior
contributors or team leads.</li>
<li>Ask them to champion consistent documentation practices within their
team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pilot and Iterate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a single, smaller project or a single team.</li>
<li>Gather feedback on the process, fix pain points, then roll out a
refined version department-wide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify Auditing vs. Technical Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize that “documentation for audit” (tasks in Azure DevOps,
compliance checklists) can be separate from “developer documentation”
(code-level explanations, architecture diagrams).</li>
<li>Overlap may exist, but the audience and purpose differ.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>“Documentation” is a broad term that means different things to
different people. In an environment with diverse teams (Data Governance,
Analytics, Engineering, BI), each producing different deliverables for
various audiences (internal developers, auditors, end users), you need a
flexible but standardized approach. The key is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Obtain buy-in from leadership</strong> to validate
documentation requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Create a minimal, shared structure</strong> that still
allows each team to adapt as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate and refine</strong>—documentation practices often
evolve over time as the teams and their deliverables change.</li>
</ol>
<p>This balanced approach helps ensure each team’s work is clearly
captured for both day-to-day operational benefits (future maintenance,
project handovers) and broader organizational needs (audit compliance,
intangible asset verification).</p>

<strong>A Tutorial on Overcoming the “Wicked Problem” of Documentation,
Tapping Subject Matter Experts, and Avoiding a Low Bus
Factor</strong></h1>
<p>Organizations often struggle to implement effective documentation
strategies, especially when diverse teams and evolving requirements are
involved. In this tutorial, we’ll explore three interrelated
challenges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The “Wicked Problem” nature of creating a documentation
solution.</li>
<li>The dilemma with subject matter experts (SMEs) who already “know the
answer.”</li>
<li>The “bus factor,” which highlights the risk of single-person
dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding these concepts and employing practical strategies,
you can improve how your organization captures and retains
knowledge.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="understanding-the-wicked-problem-of-documentation">1.
Understanding the Wicked Problem of Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>What is a Wicked Problem?</strong><br />
A wicked problem is one where the requirements are unclear or change
over time, and there’s no single “right” solution. Documentation in a
multi-team environment (e.g., Data Governance, Data Analytics, Data
Engineering, and Business Intelligence) exemplifies a wicked problem
because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Stakeholders, Multiple Needs</strong><br />
Each team has different deliverables and audiences for
documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Unclear or Evolving Constraints</strong><br />
Organizational priorities, technology stacks, and personnel often shift,
requiring documentation practices to adapt.</li>
<li><strong>No Definitive Finish Line</strong><br />
A single approach might work momentarily but must be revisited or
iterated on as the organization grows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Tips for Tackling This Wicked Problem</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Start Small and Iterate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implement a pilot documentation standard on a limited project.
Gather feedback and refine before rolling out more broadly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Establish Shared Minimums</strong>
<ul>
<li>Define a core “template” or “checklist” for everyone to follow
(e.g., file naming conventions, required fields like “owner” and “last
updated”), but allow each team to add or tailor sections to their unique
context.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Seek Managerial or Leadership Buy-In</strong>
<ul>
<li>The complexity of a wicked problem usually demands leadership
support. Show the risks of not documenting (e.g., bottlenecks, delayed
onboarding, audit issues) and ask for a mandate that encourages team
participation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="subject-matter-experts-the-paradox-of-knowledge-holders">2.
Subject Matter Experts: The Paradox of Knowledge Holders</h2>
<p><strong>The SME Dilemma</strong><br />
The person most qualified to document a system or process is often the
person least motivated to do so. They already know the details by heart,
so writing it all down can feel like an unnecessary extra
step—particularly under tight deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies to Capture SME Knowledge</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pair Writing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Match the SME with a colleague who needs the knowledge. The SME
explains verbally while the colleague documents in real time. This
leverages the SME’s expertise without making them handle all the
clerical work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Documentation Sprints</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allocate short, dedicated sessions for SMEs to share important
information. Make sure someone else is capturing the details in a shared
repository.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incentives and Cultural Norms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Encourage (or require) SMEs to document by tying it to performance
reviews, career progression, or by highlighting how good documentation
reduces long-term interruptions for everyone (including the SME).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Maintenance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Foster a “leave it better than you found it” mindset, where any time
the SME (or anyone) modifies a piece of code or process, they add or
update documentation accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bus-factor-avoiding-single-points-of-failure">3. The Bus
Factor: Avoiding Single Points of Failure</h2>
<p><strong>What is the Bus Factor?</strong><br />
Also known as a “knowledge single-point-of-failure,” the bus factor
quantifies how many people on a team can be “lost” (due to departure,
leave, sudden unavailability) before a project is at risk. A bus factor
of 1 means only one person understands a critical process—so if that
person disappears, the project stalls.</p>
<p><strong>Why a Low Bus Factor is Risky</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operational Delays</strong><br />
Getting a newcomer up to speed can be slow and error-prone if no one
else has the necessary knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Pressure on Other Team Members</strong><br />
Others must scramble to learn or maintain the abandoned system—often at
the expense of their own tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Critical Errors</strong><br />
Without the original expert, new maintainers might introduce mistakes
simply because they lack the big-picture understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies to Improve the Bus Factor</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Cross-Training</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rotate tasks or pair up team members so that knowledge is shared
organically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Job Shadowing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Encourage occasional “shadow” days where one team member observes an
SME’s routine tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Repositories and Version Control</strong>
<ul>
<li>Keep code, diagrams, and process docs in a central, accessible
place. The more transparent the workflow, the easier it is for a second
person to learn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regular Knowledge-Sharing Meetings</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hold short, recurring sessions where teammates explain a specific
process or update. This raises overall team awareness and reduces
single-person risk.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together">4. Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p><strong>1. Recognize the Complexity (Wicked Problem)</strong><br />
Documentation across different teams won’t be solved overnight.
Understand that it’s an ongoing challenge requiring leadership
commitment, iterative improvement, and flexible frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>2. Encourage SMEs to Share</strong><br />
Adopt practical methods—pair writing, documentation sprints, cultural
incentives—to capture crucial knowledge from the experts who are
otherwise least inclined to write it down.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reduce Single Points of Failure (Bus
Factor)</strong><br />
Consciously distribute knowledge across multiple people, ensuring at
least one backup per critical domain. Cross-training and collaborative
documentation practices help increase your bus factor.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion-1">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Documentation is both an art and a strategy, made more complex by
differing team needs, SME bottlenecks, and the risk of losing critical
knowledge if key people leave. By viewing the challenge as a wicked
problem, employing structured methods to capture SME expertise, and
boosting your bus factor, you create a more resilient, adaptive
organization—one better able to respond to change and maintain
continuity of operations.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">3</h1>
<p>Below is a concise “Project Description” that captures the key points
and current progress. You can share this summary with all team members
to ensure everyone has a clear, unified understanding of the
initiative.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="project-description-documentation-centralization-standardization">Project
Description: Documentation Centralization &amp; Standardization</h2>
<h3 id="background-objective">Background &amp; Objective</h3>
<p>The <strong>Corporate Data &amp; Analytics</strong> department is
tackling longstanding issues with how we create, store, and access
documentation. Currently, critical information is scattered across
various platforms (e.g., Azure DevOps, SharePoint, email, chat), and
there is no consistent method to find or create new documentation. Our
goal is to establish a <strong>centralized, standardized, and
user-friendly</strong> system that enables easier knowledge sharing,
ensures continuity, and supports our auditing requirements.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Central Knowledge Base</strong><br />
Store all departmental documentation in a structured format (e.g.,
Markdown) within Azure DevOps Repos.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Templates</strong><br />
Develop a small set of standardized templates for key documentation
types (e.g., policies, processes, technical guides).</li>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Website</strong><br />
Build a pipeline that converts Markdown files in the repo into a
browsable website, allowing for simple navigation and search.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Enabled Workflows</strong> (Longer Term)
<ul>
<li><strong>Speech-to-Text + Templates</strong>: Streamline document
creation by taking audio input, converting it to text, and using an AI
tool to format that text into standardized Markdown.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>: Provide an
AI-based Q&amp;A interface that retrieves relevant documents from the
knowledge base to answer user queries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="current-state">Current State</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Initial Platform Setup</strong>
<ul>
<li>An Azure DevOps project has been created with a dedicated repository
for Markdown files.</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of Markdown has been shared among team members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Templates in Development</strong>
<ul>
<li>A few core templates (e.g., “Process Documentation,” “Policy,”
“Technical Write-up”) are being drafted and tested.</li>
<li>Each team (Business Intelligence, Data Analytics, Data Governance,
and Data Engineering) is providing feedback to ensure these templates
meet their needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>MVP Planning</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> is scheduled for
completion in about two weeks.</li>
<li>The MVP will include:
<ul>
<li>A small set of Markdown documents demonstrating the new format.</li>
<li>A pipeline to publish these documents to a basic website or static
page.</li>
<li>Optionally, a simple AI prototype (RAG or speech-to-text workflow)
using generic, non-sensitive data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Compliance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive or proprietary information will <em>not</em> be included
in the MVP.</li>
<li>The team is engaging cybersecurity to define future guidelines for
handling confidential content.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Finalize MVP Scope</strong>
<ul>
<li>Confirm exactly which templates and documents will be included.</li>
<li>Set up the pipeline for auto-publishing Markdown to a web
interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conduct Template Trials</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gather real or representative content from each team to validate
templates.</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback to refine the structure and formatting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prototype AI Integration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate how an AI tool could transform raw text (e.g.,
speech-to-text) into the standardized templates.</li>
<li>Explore a basic Q&amp;A feature (RAG) using non-sensitive
documentation samples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Plan for Rollout &amp; Governance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discuss how documentation ownership and periodic reviews will ensure
accuracy over time.</li>
<li>Evaluate longer-term licensing and cost considerations for the full
solution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Contact/Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have questions about the MVP timeline, templates, or AI
experiments, reach out to the project team.</li>
<li>For concerns about security or data sensitivity, please coordinate
with our cybersecurity liaison.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This project aims to <strong>centralize and streamline</strong> how we
handle departmental knowledge. By creating standardized templates,
storing everything in a single repository, and eventually leveraging AI
for faster document creation and retrieval, we’ll reduce duplicated
effort, minimize knowledge gaps, and improve overall efficiency and
compliance. The upcoming MVP demonstration will showcase our progress
and serve as a foundation for continued development.</p>
