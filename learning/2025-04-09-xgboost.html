  <body><p>Not in the conventional sense. XGBoost is fundamentally a supervised
learning algorithm, intended for regression, classification, or ranking
tasks where you provide labeled data. By contrast, cluster analysis (or
segmentation) is typically an unsupervised problem—meaning you do not
have predefined labels or “true” segment membership.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-xgboost-is-not-used-for-clustering">Why XGBoost is not used
for clustering</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Designed for Supervised Tasks</strong><br />
XGBoost and other gradient-boosted decision tree packages assume you
have a target variable (e.g., a class label in classification, a numeric
value in regression, etc.). Cluster analysis typically <em>does not</em>
have such a labeled target.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Native Unsupervised Mode</strong><br />
XGBoost doesn’t ship with a built-in “unsupervised” or “clustering”
mode, whereas traditional clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN,
hierarchical clustering) explicitly look for patterns or groups in
unlabeled data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objective and Loss Functions</strong><br />
XGBoost’s strength lies in its flexible objective functions—like
logistic loss for classification, squared error for regression, etc.
Clustering involves a different concept of “distance” or similarity
between data points, which is not something XGBoost focuses on.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-you-might-still-use-xgboost-in-a-segmentation-pipeline">How
you <em>might</em> still use XGBoost in a segmentation pipeline</h3>
<p>Though you wouldn’t use XGBoost for raw clustering, there are
creative ways it can appear in a segmentation process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Pre/Post-Processing with XGBoost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Processing</strong>: You could use XGBoost as a feature
engineering tool (for example, to produce new features or embeddings).
Then, you feed those features into a clustering algorithm (like
k-means).</li>
<li><strong>Post-Processing</strong>: If you have existing segments or
labels (e.g., from a domain expert or from a previous clustering), you
could treat them as <em>labels</em> in a supervised task and train
XGBoost to predict these segments for new data. That’s not truly
“clustering,” but rather a way to classify new records into known
segments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Semi-Supervised Settings</strong><br />
If you have partial labels or “pseudo-labels,” you can try to
iteratively refine them using a supervised approach. Some advanced
workflows involve pseudo-labeling and then training a model to classify
new points—though this is more advanced and still not pure
clustering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surrogate Modeling</strong><br />
If you need an interpretable model of why data points cluster the way
they do, you can sometimes fit a tree-based model (like XGBoost) to
“explain” cluster membership that was determined by a separate
clustering algorithm. The idea is to see which features best separate
your existing clusters—but again, you’re not <em>performing</em> the
clustering in XGBoost itself.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Clustering</strong>: Methods like k-means, hierarchical
clustering, Gaussian Mixtures, or DBSCAN remain the go-to for
unsupervised cluster analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Role for XGBoost</strong>: It can be valuable in a
segmentation workflow if you already have labeled segments (or if you’re
transforming features for another clustering tool). But it is not a
conventional clustering tool on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you already have 23 well-defined “subclusters” (or segments) but
want to consolidate them into, say, 4–5 higher-level groups, you can
think of it as a <em>cluster-of-clusters</em> (sometimes called
<em>meta-clustering</em>). Here are a few approaches you could
consider:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="cluster-the-centroids-meta-clustering">1) Cluster the Centroids
(Meta-Clustering)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Represent Each Cluster by Its Centroid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For each of your 23 clusters, compute its centroid (the average of
all data points in that cluster).</li>
<li>You now have 23 “centroid points,” each describing one cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply a New Clustering Algorithm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a standard clustering method (e.g., k-means, hierarchical
clustering, etc.) on these 23 centroid points.</li>
<li>Choose (k = 4) or (k = 5) for your desired number of higher-level
clusters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Assign the Original Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the original clusters (and thus all data points within them)
naturally inherits the new meta-cluster label from its centroid’s
assignment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is straightforward but does rely on the centroid as the
main representation of each cluster, which might miss nuances if the
clusters are broad or non-spherical.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="hierarchical-clustering-on-the-clusters-themselves">2)
Hierarchical Clustering on the Clusters Themselves</h2>
<p>If you prefer a more flexible approach than computing centroids, you
can do a pairwise clustering of the clusters themselves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Compute Cluster-to-Cluster Distances</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For each pair of the 23 clusters, define a distance measure. Common
options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Centroid distance</strong>: Distance between centroids of
two clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Complete-link</strong>: Maximum distance between any two
points in different clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Average-link</strong>: Average distance between all pairs of
points in different clusters.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Build a Dendrogram (Hierarchical Tree)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to
iteratively merge the most similar clusters.</li>
<li>Visualize the resulting dendrogram, then “cut” it at the level that
yields 4–5 top-level groups.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This method can capture more intricate differences between clusters
compared to just using the centroids.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="re-cluster-the-original-data-with-fewer-clusters">3) Re-Cluster
the Original Data with Fewer Clusters</h2>
<p>Another possibility is to ignore the existing 23-cluster segmentation
altogether and re-run the clustering on the original data with (k = 4)
or (k = 5). Sometimes the initial 23 clusters might have been an
over-segmentation, or they might have been derived under different
constraints (e.g., domain rules, time-of-day segments, etc.). If you’re
not bound to them, you could:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Use the original data</strong> and your chosen clustering
method (k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.), with a target of 4–5
clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> whether these fewer, brand-new clusters
make sense for your business or analytic problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if the 23 clusters are meaningful and must remain as the
“building blocks,” the meta-clustering approach is usually better.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="combine-quantitative-methods-with-domain-knowledge">4) Combine
Quantitative Methods with Domain Knowledge</h2>
<p>When merging segments, it’s often helpful to incorporate domain
knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Similarity in domain terms</strong>: If two existing
clusters were formed based on different days of the week, but they have
essentially the same demographics or purchasing behavior, you might
combine them.</li>
<li><strong>Business constraints</strong>: If certain clusters need to
remain distinct (e.g., “VIP” vs. “General” categories), you can isolate
those before merging the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you’ll find that <strong>hierarchical clustering + domain
knowledge</strong> is the easiest approach—hierarchical clustering gives
you a dendrogram that suggests the best merges, and you pick the cut
points that make the most business sense.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="bottom-line-1">Bottom Line</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta-clustering</strong> (clustering the clusters) is quick
and works well if each cluster can be represented adequately by its
centroid or some summary statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical clustering</strong> on the pairwise distances
between clusters often provides a more nuanced approach to merging.</li>
<li>If you’re not attached to the existing 23-cluster structure, you
could just re-run a clustering algorithm on the original data aiming for
4–5 clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Always blend in domain knowledge</strong> to ensure the
merged clusters still make practical sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should help you systematically “condense” those 23 clusters down
to about 4–5 more general groupings.</p>
<p>Hierarchical clustering in its <em>classical</em> form (e.g.,
agglomerative clustering) requires calculating and storing all pairwise
distances among data points—an (O(n^2)) operation in both time and
memory. For very large datasets (e.g., 500k rows), this can become
impractical or outright impossible on typical hardware.</p>
<p>That said, there are several strategies and variants that can make
hierarchical-like clustering feasible at large scale:</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="sampling-or-partial-clustering-approach">1) Sampling or Partial
Clustering Approach</h2>
<p>One simple and common workaround is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sample</strong> a manageable subset of your data (e.g.,
10k–50k points).</li>
<li>Perform hierarchical clustering on that sample.</li>
<li><strong>Assign</strong> the remaining points to the hierarchical
clusters obtained from the sample, based on nearest centroid or some
distance metric.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives you a hierarchical solution, albeit with some
approximation due to the sampling step.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="hierarchical-clustering-on-clusters-two-stage-or-meta-clustering">2)
Hierarchical Clustering on Clusters (Two-Stage or
“Meta-Clustering”)</h2>
<p>Another approach is to do an initial (non-hierarchical)
clustering—like k-means, or mini-batch k-means—on the entire 500k data,
creating a few hundred or thousand clusters. Then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Represent each mini-cluster</strong> by its centroid (or
some representative).</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchically cluster</strong> these centroids in a second
stage.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can then map each original data point to the hierarchical
structure of its centroid. This is effectively <em>meta-clustering</em>
of the first-stage clusters.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="approximatescalable-hierarchical-algorithms">3)
Approximate/Scalable Hierarchical Algorithms</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Canopy Clustering</strong>: A <em>pre-clustering</em> or
“canopy” approach that uses cheap distance measures (like TF-IDF +
approximate nearest neighbors) to group similar points into overlapping
“canopies,” then does more expensive clustering steps within these
canopies.</li>
<li><strong>HDBSCAN</strong>: An extension of DBSCAN that produces a
hierarchy of clusterings. Though still not trivial with 500k rows, it
can be more efficient than naive hierarchical clustering due to advanced
data structures and optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Other Distributed/Approximate Methods</strong>: Some
libraries or frameworks (e.g., Spark’s MLlib, RAPIDS cuML on GPU)
provide specialized or approximate versions of hierarchical algorithms
that can handle large datasets in a distributed or GPU-accelerated
manner.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="hardware-considerations-scaling-up-vs.-scaling-out">4) Hardware
Considerations (Scaling Up vs. Scaling Out)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaling Up</strong>: More RAM, bigger machine (e.g., 100+ GB
of RAM). You still face a potential (O(n^2)) memory/time cost.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling Out</strong>: Using a distributed framework like
Spark might help if the implementation supports a parallel or
approximate hierarchical approach. Some scikit-learn or SciPy
hierarchical algorithms may not trivially distribute across multiple
machines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="practical-takeaways">Practical Takeaways</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Classical Hierarchical Clustering on 500k Rows Is Usually
Impractical</strong><br />
Due to (O(n^2)) complexity, your machine might run out of memory or take
an extremely long time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Approximate or Two-Stage Solutions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sampling</strong>: Hierarchical cluster a subset; assign the
rest.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-Clustering</strong>: First cluster data into
“micro-clusters,” then hierarchically cluster those.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Check Out Scalable Alternatives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you truly need a hierarchical approach, libraries like HDBSCAN or
Spark-based solutions might be worth exploring.</li>
<li>If your primary goal is to get high-level clusters (not necessarily
a full dendrogram structure), other clustering algorithms (k-means,
DBSCAN, etc.) might be more practical.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="bottom-line-2">Bottom Line</h3>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, you <em>can</em> do hierarchical clustering on
a large dataset, but <strong>naive hierarchical clustering</strong> on
500k rows is typically infeasible. Employing approximations—like
sampling or meta-clustering—or using specialized scalable
implementations is the usual path forward.</p>
