 In its simplest form, an annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company that a person buys with a lump sum or a series of payments with the intention of the benefit to be paid back to them. At Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, we offer two different annuities, the qualified flexible premium deferred annuity and non-qualified single premium deferred annuity. While they are different products, they do have some similarities. Both of our annuity products have a deferred payout, which means the payout does not begin immediately, allowing your money to grow tax deferred until withdrawn. Our annuity products are also both fixed annuities, and both annuity products have guaranteed income options that can provide a stream of payments in the future. Here are some questions to ask yourself before purchasing an annuity. Do you use the annuity to save for retirement or a similar long-term goal? Do you intend to remain in the annuity long enough to avoid paying any surrender charges to SFBIC and early distribution penalties to the IRS? Do you understand a fixed annuity has a minimum guaranteed interest rate but could earn a higher rate? Have you consulted with a tax advisor and considered any tax consequences of purchasing an annuity?
